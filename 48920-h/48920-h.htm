<h2 class="p4">PREFACE.</h2>

<p class="pn2"><span class="smcap">The</span> Author has prepared this work for the press
somewhat hastily, and under many circumstances
which heavily oppressed him; he hopes therefore
that the want of arrangement, and the dearth of
matter which may be observed in his narrative, will
not subject it to a severe condemnation. In presenting
it to the public, he is not actuated by any personal
considerations, his object being to convey some
information respecting the resources of a country,
and the character of a people, which have been so
variously represented. The short delineation here
attempted will, in all probability, suffice to shew that
the accounts which have been given at different times
of Hayti and its inhabitants have been much too
highly coloured by the zealous advocates of negro
independence; and he is ready to confess that at
one time he was somewhat dazzled by the description,
and was almost made a convert to their opinions.
It having been his lot however, at a subsequent
period, to hold considerable intercourse with
the country, he has been enabled to form what he
considers a more correct estimate of its present condition.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
Experience has convinced him that the representations
so generally received of the improvement
which it has made are greatly exaggerated, and
he is not without the hope that the following sheets
will convey more correct information on the subject,
and thus prove useful to the merchant, if not interesting
to the general reader.</p>

<p>He readily admits that in the historical part
he has touched upon matters which have been already
handled by other and much abler writers;
this could not be very well avoided, the annals of
Hayti affording but few events, and those having
been often detailed. He conceived that such a
summary of the history of the country would be
necessary to illustrate the cause of the revolution,
to shew the decline which ensued in agriculture and
commerce, the decay of knowledge, and the progress
of vice and immorality among the inhabitants.</p>

<p>Actuated therefore by the desire of throwing some
light on the state of Hayti, and giving a faithful
representation of the condition of its population,
he ventures to solicit the attention of the public
to the facts which have fallen under his own personal
observation.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p class="pn2"><span class="smcap">An</span> account of the present state of Hayti I believe
has not yet been submitted to the public; to offer
one likely to meet with a favourable reception is, I
am aware, an undertaking of considerable difficulty:
it requires, no doubt, that the author should be well
skilled in the various branches of knowledge, in
order to render it in every respect satisfactory and
interesting to the public. Ignorant as I acknowledge
myself to be in the higher walks of philosophy,
and educated solely for the more humble avocations
of a mercantile life, I can lay no claim to
such acquirements: I must therefore rest my hope
of commanding any degree of attention, on the
truth and correctness of the statements which I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
shall produce, founded as they are on actual observation.
I am conscious that I am standing on delicate
ground, and touching on a subject likely to
excite angry feelings in those who have long been
the eulogists of the republic, who have been its advocates
when assailed, and who have held it forth
to the world as a country in which wealth abounds,
virtue flourishes, and freedom reigns triumphant,
instead of the oppression, the vice, and the poverty
which once prevailed there; but I will not shrink
from the undertaking, though powerful obstacles
may present themselves, and formidable opponents
be arrayed against me. My object in the following
sheets is, to endeavour to dissipate this delusion, and
to shew that there is nothing to warrant the unqualified
panegyrics poured forth by those individuals who
have been the most conspicuous for their zeal and enthusiasm,
in holding up Hayti as a “land flowing
with milk and honey”. In the performance of this,
I have no other aim than that of benefiting the
merchant and capitalist, the manufacturer, and the
trader, who have had no opportunity of visiting a
country to which their speculations in commerce
may lead them, by guarding them against the shoals
and quicksands upon which adventurers, destitute of
information, are so frequently wrecked.</p>

<p>The admirers of Hayti have been very industrious
in circulating the most deceptive accounts of
the state of its commerce, by garbled and exaggerated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
specifications. They have led many to believe
that its imports and exports are daily on the
increase, and that the resources of the people for
the purchase of the products and manufactures of
other states receive a gradual and steady augmentation.
I am much deceived if I shall not succeed
in convincing the reader that this representation is
a perfect delusion, and that from the diminished
means of the people, the commerce of Hayti, instead
of increasing, annually sustains a considerable
diminution; and that while the present state of
things continues to exist&mdash;while its rulers are weak
and imbecile, and the mass of the population are
kept in a state of the grossest ignorance&mdash;there does
not appear a ray of hope that any improvement may
take place in the circumstances of the country, or
that any change will be effected, likely to prove advantageous
to foreigners disposed to embark in an
intercourse with Hayti.</p>

<p>Several visits to Hayti&mdash;in two of which I had,
from the nature of my mission, occasion to remain
there a considerable time&mdash;gave me opportunities of
seeing the actual state of it, in all its different
branches of agriculture, commerce, finances, and
the moral and religious condition of its people, together
with the state of its government and the
views of its chief. I am therefore encouraged to
hope that my details may be productive of some
benefit to the commercial part of the community,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
and not be altogether unacceptable to others, whose
avocations are different, but who may be desirous of
correct information respecting those parts of the
globe of which they may know but little except the
name.</p>

<p>An historical account of Hayti would be a superfluous
undertaking; I see nothing to add to what
has already been written by Charlevoix, Raynal,
Edwards, Walton, and others, in their elaborate
and voluminous works, and who have omitted nothing
interesting, or worthy of being recorded, from
its first discovery by the illustrious Columbus down
to a very recent period. Every event connected
with its history seems to have been most faithfully
detailed by these writers, and their works are entitled
to the highest credit and consideration, as containing
the best and most authentic account of this
very extensive island.</p>

<p>Impelled, no doubt, as they were with a desire
to afford to the world every possible information relative
to the resources of the country, and of the
character and general habits of the people, they
have left little to be performed by their successors,
except to notice the changes and events which may
have taken place since the date of their latest productions.
Besides a copious and a faithful historical
sketch, they have given a correct statistical view
of its agriculture, its commerce, and public revenue;
they have also pointed out the slow advances made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
by the people in industry, in morality, and in general
knowledge: but little, therefore, remains to
be said on these subjects, except to call the attention
of the reader to the striking contrast which the present
situation of the republic exhibits, when compared
with that which it displayed before the revolution;
to give a brief sketch of Hayti as it is, with
an occasional reference to Hayti as it was. I must
beg leave to assure my readers, that in executing
this task, I am actuated by no unfair nor unjust
motives; I am only anxious that the highly coloured
statements which have been published respecting its
present wealth and prosperity should be submitted
to the test of candid and impartial scrutiny. For a
series of years Hayti has been made the theme of
constant praise, and has excited no little share of
the public attention, on account of the unexampled
efforts which its slave population made to throw
off the fetters by which they had been previously
bound, and on account of their having, as their
eulogists declare, made the most rapid and extraordinary
strides in civilization and social improvement.
It must be admitted that the revolution
effected in Hayti, was an event almost unparalleled
in history; and that a people just emerging
from a state of barbarism should have so successfully
combated and defeated the finest troops
of France, is no doubt a circumstance calculated to
call forth no trifling portion of astonishment and admiration:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
but when the partial eulogists of the Haytians
go to the length of asserting that they have
arrived at a high degree of moral improvement, that
they have reached a state of refinement little inferior
to that which generally prevails in Europe, the
limits of truth are overstepped: such overstrained
assertions are totally destitute even of the semblance
of truth, and my personal experience enables me to
declare, in the most explicit and unqualified terms,
that at this very moment, the people of Hayti are
in a worse state of ignorance than the slave population
in the British colonies. There are some cases,
it is true, in which instances of intelligence have been
discovered in the Haytian citizen, but this never
occurs except where individuals have had the advantages
of an European education, or who, being
the descendants of persons who previously to the
revolution were possessed of wealth, had the means
of travelling, for the purpose of acquiring the manners
and customs of more enlightened nations. But
taking the people in the aggregate, they are far from
having made any advances in knowledge.</p>

<p>It has also been commonly asserted by the friends
of Hayti, and I believe very generally credited in
Europe, that it preserves its agricultural pre-eminence
solely by free labour; now I think I shall be
able to prove to a demonstration that this is not the
case, and that it is too evident, from every document
that has yet appeared on the subject, that agriculture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
has been long on the wane, and has sunk to the
lowest possible ebb in every district of the republic;
that the true art and principles of the culture of
the soil, are not understood, or if in the least known,
they are not practically applied. There is nothing
to be seen having the least resemblance to a colony,
flourishing in the wealth derived from a properly
regulated system of agriculture.</p>

<p>On the subject of free labour I shall have occasion
to offer a few remarks, and I trust that in doing
so, I shall not be considered as inimical to it, where-ever
it may be found practicable to obtain it; on
the contrary, no man would be more happy to see
that our own colonies could be cultivated by free
labour, provided a full compensation should be honourably
made to those whose interests might be endangered
by the experiment, if unsuccessful; but I
shall, I think, be able to shew that this is <i>absolutely
impracticable</i>, and that the system of labour so pursued
in Hayti, instead of affording us a proof of
what may be accomplished by it, is illustrative of
the fact, that it is by coercion, and coercion only,
that any return can be expected from the employment
of capital in the cultivation of soil in our
West India islands. I shall also be able to shew
that Hayti presents no instance in which the cultivation
of the soil is successfully carried on without
the application of force to constrain the labourer:
on the estates of every individual connected with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
the government, all the labourers employed work
under the superintendence of a military police, and
it is on these properties alone that any thing resembling
successful agriculture exists in Hayti. I
am aware that this will excite the astonishment of
persons who have been accustomed to think otherwise;
but I shall state facts which cannot be controverted,
even by President Boyer himself&mdash;nay,
I shall produce circumstances which I have seen
with the utmost surprise on his own estate; circumstances
that must shew his warmest advocates,
that all his boasted productions have not been obtained
without the application of that system against
which they loudly exclaim.</p>

<p>Instead of holding out an example of what might
be accomplished by a people released from bondage,
without first having been prepared for freedom by
moral and religious instruction, I think Hayti rather
forms a beacon to warn us against the dangers
and difficulties by which that unhappy country has
been overtaken. The present condition of Hayti,
arising from the events which have taken place since
the revolution, should render us exceedingly cautious
how we plunge our own colonies into the same misery
and calamity; by conferring on a rude and untaught
people, without qualification, or without the least
restraint, an uncontrolled command over themselves.
However acutely we may feel for the miseries to
which the West Indian slave was at one period subjected,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
yet I cannot conceive it possible that any one
can be so destitute of correct information on the subject
as not to know, that at this moment the slave is
in a condition far more happy, that he possesses infinitely
greater comforts and enjoyments, than any class
of labourers in Hayti, and that, from the judicious
measures which have been already adopted by the
colonial legislatures, and from others which are in
contemplation, for improving the condition of the
slave, it is very rational to conclude that before long
slavery will only be considered as a name; and that
were it to receive any other designation it would furnish
no peg on which the European philanthropist
might hang his declamations against slavery.</p>

<p>To place the slaves in the British colonies upon
a footing with the free labourers in Hayti, or with
the largest proportion of the people in that country,
would be a work of easy accomplishment; but the
effect would be, to cause them to exchange a state
of comparative plenty and comfort, for one in
which every species of tyranny and oppression, with
their concomitants, disease and want, are most lamentably
conspicuous. Whatever may be the views
of the British Cabinet relative to their colonies, I
should warn it to steer clear of the erroneous policy
which has proved so fatal to Hayti, and should it
be determined that a change should be introduced
into the policy hitherto pursued with so much success,
and with so much advantage in our colonial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
possessions, I trust it will not be by emancipating
the slave, before he is prepared for freedom by a
proper moral and religious education. Let the
system of slavery be gradually improved, and the
slave will glide imperceptibly into a state of freedom.</p>

<p>It is not my intention, in this early stage of my
remarks, to enter into any lengthened detail of the
disunion or want of cordiality subsisting between
the two classes of people in Hayti: this I shall reserve
for its proper place; where it will be seen, that
a very strong dissatisfaction prevails amongst the
black population, which manifests itself upon almost
every occasion of celebrating public events, and
festivities. This acrimonious feeling evidently arises
from the jealousy excited by the predominant influence
of the coloured people in the government.
This influence, detrimental as it may be to the good
order and repose of the country, is courted and
nurtured by the president, to the great danger of
overthrowing the whole establishment. One or two
attempts at revolt have been made by the people of
the north, who were the subjects of the late Christophe,
and from these efforts, although abortive, it
may be inferred, that the spirit for a more extensive
commotion still lurks in their minds, and that the
least possible irritation would so agitate and inflame
them, that the whole would be thrown into a scene
of disorder, tumult, and irremediable confusion.
The combinations are numerous and powerful, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
such was the extraordinary apathy of the government,
that until a communication was made by an
individual to Boyer, neither he nor any one of his
officers had the least intimation that such proceedings
were in contemplation. The want of energy
visible in the government makes it obnoxious to the
people, and no country like Hayti can be expected
to remain long in repose and tranquillity, unless its
governors possess both talent and resolution to command.</p>

<p>That the government of Hayti is the most inefficient
and enervated of any of the modern republics
cannot be denied, and I cannot see the least
hope of an improvement, unless there be a complete
revision of its constitution, and a new one framed,
better suited to the tastes of the people, and more
adapted to their present very rude state of knowledge.
From the present rulers it would be vain to
expect any effort which might prove beneficial to
the country; any attempt to cultivate or improve
the habits and morals of the people, or to promote
agriculture. The members composing the present
government, seem to consider the poverty and ignorance
of the people, as the best safeguards of the
security and permanence of their own property and
power.</p>

<p>A recognition of the independence of Hayti by
Great Britain may give some strength to the measures
of its government, because the people have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
called out loudly for the protection of that power,
whilst they have as loudly exclaimed against the
policy pursued towards France. No event in its history
has excited in the republic greater abhorrence
or more general murmuring, than the act of purchasing
from France that which it had de facto possessed
for twenty-one years unmolested and undisturbed;
thereby at once admitting the sovereignty of that
power over the island, and which sovereignty France
will, at some convenient period, unquestionably assert,
and that without the least fear of any inconvenient
consequences arising from it; for what
power can give aid to the Haytians against France,
when the former have openly and formally admitted
themselves to be a colony dependent upon the
French crown. Whatever intercourse Englishmen
may be disposed to maintain with Hayti, it is indispensable
that they should use the most vigilant
precaution, and exact a rigid adherence to such
treaties as may have been entered into, if they
would avoid certain loss; for the Haytian character,
taken generally, will be found, so far from being
entitled either to credit or confidence, not even to
possess common honesty. Compacts with them are
easily made; but a faithful adherence to agreements
must not be expected;&mdash;their maxim is to break
them, whenever they find it can be accomplished
with advantage.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class="pch">Situation and general description of the French and
Spanish divisions, previously to the Revolution in the
former country.</p>

<p class="pn2"><span class="smcap">The</span> island of St. Domingo, once the abode of
fertility, and the scene of extraordinary political
changes and events, lies in latitude 18° 20´ north
and in longitude 68° 40´ west from Greenwich,
having on its west the islands of Cuba and Jamaica,
on its east Porto Rico, the Bahamas on its north,
and bounded southerly by the Carribean Sea. Its
extent has been variously stated; but Edwards, who
describes it to be about 390 miles in length from
east to west, seems the most correct; and it appears
from late surveys to be nearly 150 miles in breadth
from north to south. The Abbé Raynal has represented
it at 200 leagues in length, and from 60
to 80 in breadth, but it is evident that his estimation
is erroneous. Rainsford also states it to be
about 450 miles in length, but from every information
which I could obtain, its length does not appear
to exceed 400 miles, nor its breadth 140. The
reader, therefore, must look into these discrepances,
and judge between them. As it is not easy to survey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
a country intersected by wilds and impenetrable
mountains, much is necessarily left to conjecture.</p>

<p>It is the most extensive, and was at one period of
its history the most productive of the Antilles, and
was called by the aborigines Haiti, or Highland, and
by which ancient designation it is now generally
known, that of St. Domingo having been abolished
at the revolution. To convey an adequate idea of
what this once delightful island was, is not the object
of the present work; on this head it is sufficient
to observe that in the richness and extent of its productions,
and in its local beauties, it exceeded every
other island in the western hemisphere, and that the
two divisions of the east and the west, when under
the respective governments of Spain and France,
were considered and indeed known to be the most
splendid and most important appendages to those
crowns. Its plains and valleys presented the most
inviting scenes from the richness of the pastures and
the verdure with which they eternally abounded.
Its mountains were also said to contain ores of the
most valuable kind, and produce timber admirably
adapted for every useful or ornamental purpose.
Nothing could exceed the extreme salubrity of the
whole country, nor could it be surpassed in the vast
exuberance of its luscious fruits, and in those productions
of the soil which became the general articles
of export, and from which all the wealth and
all commerce of this colony flowed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>The French division, though infinitely less extensive
than the Spanish part, and not containing a
third of the whole island, has been considered the
most valuable spot in the western world. The
Spanish division however has greater natural resources,
and affords greater facilities for agricultural
operations: but the very extraordinary exertions of
the French planter in the culture of the soil, compensated
for the want of those advantages possessed
by their Spanish neighbours, who, more indolently
disposed, relied on the produce of their mines, which
afforded, as they imagined, greater local riches than
those which could be obtained from either agriculture
or commerce, forgetting that these alone furnish
the wealth which can render any country really
and permanently prosperous and great.</p>

<p>It appears from every authority, that the first
colony established here by the French, was settled
in the sixteenth century, having been attracted
thither by the Buccaneers, who had previously obtained
a footing in the island from excursions which
they often made from Tortuga, for the purpose of
hunting the bulls of the Spaniards. These hardy
and predatory warriors attracted the French, who
supplied them with such necessaries as they required,
and even sent them many settlers, with arms and
implements for defence and labour. The extreme
fertility of the country invited them to make some
efforts to gain a permanent footing in it, and by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
means of intrigue coupled with a little force, they
succeeded in obtaining possession of the whole of
the west end, the line of which seems to have run
in an oblique direction, from about Cape François
on the north to Cape Rosa on the south. Having
surmounted all the obstacles that presented themselves,
and having overcome those difficulties which
generally accompany the first attempts at colonization,
or are met with in a newly discovered land,
they pursued with incredible ardour and industry
the culture of the soil, and the improvement of their
valuable acquisition.</p>

<p>The Spanish court, jealous of and unable to contend
with their rival colonists, submitted to France,
when the two cabinets at home came to a mutual
understanding and adjustment, respecting these
foreign possessions. An arrangement was entered
into, under which commissioners were appointed
for settling the boundaries, and fixing the rights
which had formed the ground of disputes between
the settlers of these rival nations. The line of demarcation
finally agreed upon commenced at the
bay of Mansenillo on the north, dividing in its
course the river Massacre; thence taking rather
a westerly course, it reached an acute point at Dondon,
and afterwards proceeded southerly to the river
Pedernales.</p>

<p>This tract of country, as conceded to the French,
contained about 1000 square leagues, exceedingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
irregular in its character, intersected with mountains,
and having plains confined and difficult of
approach, so as to make it altogether much inferior
in point of natural value to even a single district of
the Spanish division; having also two extreme
points or capes, Cape Nicolas Mole on the north,
and Cape Tiburon on the south-west extremity, in
both of which the soil is less valuable, from its being
so very mountainous, and from its not possessing
those facilities of communication which can be obtained
in other districts. Notwithstanding the disadvantages
against which the first settlers had to
contend, and in defiance of every local obstacle,
they seemed to have been impressed with the conviction,
that if a spirit of perseverance and labour
could be diffused amongst them, they would ultimately
be richly rewarded for all their toil, and all
that anxiety and deprivation to which it appears, at
their first setting out, they were unquestionably
subjected. Their conclusions were just, and time
shewed the correctness of the principles on which
they reasoned and acted, for their colony gradually
rose in estimation; and at so early a period as the
year 1703, under the government of M. Auger, a
native of America, and who in early life had been
in a state of slavery, it had become of so much
consideration to France, that the greatest possible
efforts were made to extend their system of cultivation
to the whole of their colonial territory. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
officer was indefatigable, it is said, in his exertions
in encouraging and in stimulating the colonists in
the culture of the lands, and as he had been previously
governor of Guadaloupe, it is to be inferred
that he possessed no ordinary skill in the business of
preparing the ground for the production of those
exotic and indigenous plants which became the main
articles of export to the mother-country. That he
was a most efficient governor all writers admit, for
he had brought the state of his colony to a very
high pitch of prosperity, when he died, lamented
by all who had lived under his command. The
plantations at this period had increased in every
part, particularly in the valleys, where the soil was
more congenial, and where the labour could be performed
without being attended with those difficulties
which impeded it in the more mountainous districts.
In the western parts the cocoa-tree had begun to
produce most luxuriantly, yielding great wealth to
individuals, and a large revenue to the state. The
sugar-cane had also arrived at great perfection, and
the art of manufacturing the sugar from it had been
for some time carried on with astonishing success.
Coffee plantations were establishing, and the planters
in every direction were vying with each other in
bringing their properties into the highest possible
state of cultivation.</p>

<p>In the year 1715, however, the island suffered a
very severe calamity, and in the succeeding year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
another followed, in both of which almost all the
cocoa-trees perished, and considerable damage was
done to every vegetable production; and the planters,
who had by this time acquired an easy, if not a
competent fortune, sustained losses that only time
and continued exertion could possibly repair. It
will be seen, however, that a great improvement
gradually followed, and that agriculture had not
been neglected, for in the year 1754 the colony had
advanced to a wonderful pitch of prosperity, and
seems to have satisfied the wishes of the proprietors
of the soil, as well as the most sanguine expectations
of the government. It is said by an anonymous
writer, that “the various commodities exported
from the island amounted to a million and a
quarter sterling, and the imports to one million
seven hundred and seventy-seven thousand five
hundred and nine pounds. There were fourteen
thousand white inhabitants, nearly four thousand
free mulattoes, and one hundred and seventy-two
thousand negroes; five hundred and ninety-nine
sugar plantations, three thousand three hundred
and seventy-nine of indigo, ninety-eight thousand
nine hundred and forty-six cocoa-trees, six million
three hundred thousand three hundred and sixty-seven
cotton plants, and about twenty-two millions
of cassia-trees, sixty-three thousand horses and
mules, ninety-three thousand head of horned cattle,
six millions of banana trees, upwards of one million<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
plots of potatoes, two hundred and twenty-six thousand
of yams, and nearly three million trenches of
marrioc.”</p>

<p>From this period up to the French revolution
the colony advanced still further in prosperity, every
year adding to the wealth of the planters, and to
the revenue of the crown. Nothing could exceed
the condition into which the plantations had been
brought by their owners; a steady and enlightened
system of agriculture had been established, which
had been productive of the most beneficial results.
Every plantation, laid out with the greatest care
and neatness, was so arranged as to bring every part
of the soil into use in its proper order of succession&mdash;not
the least particle appears to have escaped the
eye of the owner, for what could not be rendered fit
for the production of the cane, served either for
cotton, coffee, indigo, or other plants. In the valleys
surrounded by mountains, the access to which
for carriages was attended with some danger, and
consequently were chiefly in pasture, the verdure
was astonishing. These valleys having small rivulets
or streams running through them, and shaded
by occasional groups of trees and shrubs, which
grew spontaneously on the margins of a spring, or
round any body of water that might occasionally be
collected from the mountain falls, became extremely
valuable for the raising of cattle for the consumption
of the planters, and on this account extremely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
profitable to their owners; for here the animals could
graze undisturbed and cool under a meridian sun,
and range unmolested, indulging in the richness of
the surrounding herbage. The culture of the land
for the sugar-cane at this period seems to have engaged
the greatest attention of the planter, for at
no time had such amazing crops been produced as
in the year preceding the revolution; the soil in the
plains of the north, Artibanite and the Cul de Sac,
being peculiarly adapted for it, from its extreme
strength and excellent quality, and from its situation,
which enabled it to receive the aid of irrigation
in seasons when drought prevails. The estates
also appropriated to the production of sugar exhibited
a degree of uniformity and order, in all the
departments of plantation labour, which can scarcely
be exceeded even at the present period, when the
system is supposed to have become more mature,
and its true principles better understood.</p>

<p>The coffee plantations had at this time arrived at
great perfection&mdash;they were extensive, and exceedingly
fruitful; for the genius and industry of the
proprietors were exerted to their utmost limits in
this branch of agriculture. Every property was divided
and subdivided into small fields, in which the
trees were planted with all that nicety and regularity
which is often seen in a well regulated nursery.
The pruning-knife and the hoe were regularly applied
to the trees requiring to be dismembered of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
their superfluous branches, and wanting nurture at
their half expiring roots. The cotton and indigo
plantations had also arrived at the height of excellence
in planting, and it was not possible that
greater abundance could have been obtained from
them, than that which was usually returned at or a
few years previously to the convulsion which took
place. The cocoa tree was also at this time exceedingly
flourishing, and much care and attention were
bestowed upon its cultivation; its produce being
found an article of no inconsiderable demand, and
extremely profitable in the returns which it yielded
the cultivator.</p>

<p>A better or clearer proof cannot be given of the
highly improved state of agriculture at this time,
than by a reference to the number of plantations
which had been established, and to the quantity of
produce which had been exported to France, with
the value of the whole, as estimated by persons
whose authority may be relied on, and who were
doubtless competent judges, from having in the
island filled situations which gave them opportunities
of fairly estimating everything connected with
the country.</p>

<p>Moreau St. Mery, a writer of great credit, and a
native of St. Domingo, states, “that in the year
1791 there were, in the French division alone,
seven hundred and ninety-three sugar estates, seven
hundred and eighty-nine cotton plantations, three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
thousand one hundred and seventeen of coffee,
three thousand one hundred and fifty of indigo,
fifty-four cocoa manufactories, and six hundred
and twenty-three smaller settlements, on which
were produced large quantities of Indian corn, rice,
pulse, and almost every description of vegetables
required for the consumption of the people. There
were also forty thousand horses, fifty thousand
mules, and two hundred and fifty thousand cattle
and sheep; and that the quantity of land actually
in cultivation was about two million two hundred
and eighty-nine thousand four hundred and eighty
acres.”</p>

<p>The quantity of produce exported from the island
to France appears, by various accounts, to have
been very large indeed, furnishing a very strong
corroboration of the flourishing state of the colony,
and of the extent to which agriculture had been
carried. It would appear that not much regard
was paid to other means by which the prosperity of
the country might have been enhanced, the inhabitants
resting solely on the culture of the soil to
exalt the island in the eyes of the parent state, and
to make it an appendage worthy to be cherished and
protected. Mr. Edwards and others have stated
the amount of exports as follows: that is to say,
about one hundred and sixty-three millions four
hundred thousand pounds of sugar, sixty-eight millions
one hundred and fifty thousand pounds of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
coffee, six millions two hundred and eighty-six
thousand pounds of cotton, nine hundred and thirty
thousand pounds of indigo, twenty-nine thousand
hogsheads of molasses, and three hundred puncheons
of rum. Walton, in his Appendix, enumerates
many other articles of export besides those which I
have named, and he states the quantity of each much
larger, and values the whole at about six millions and
ninety-four thousand two hundred and thirty pounds,
English money. The same writer observes, that the
value of the imports into the country about that
time from France was four millions one hundred
and twenty-five thousand six hundred and ten
pounds sterling. At this period, also, it appears
from authority, that the population amounted to
about forty thousand white people, twenty-eight
thousand free persons of colour, and about four
hundred and fifty-five thousand slaves; and that the
valuation of the whole of the plantations in culture,
with the buildings, slaves, cattle, and every implement
for the use of agriculture, was estimated at
fourteen hundred and ninety millions of livres, or
somewhat about seventy millions English money.</p>

<p>The Spanish division of Hayti is said to contain
two-thirds of the whole, and is estimated at about
three thousand one hundred and fifty square leagues,
an extent of country capable of affording the means
of subsistence to a population of at least seven millions
of souls. In local advantages this part certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
exceeds the western division, from its soil
being almost in a virgin state, and a very large proportion
of its valleys and elevations never having
been tilled. The indolence and inactivity inherent
in the Spanish character have been displayed in all
their colours in this part of St. Domingo; for although
their district possessed all the natural means
required to raise them to an equal pitch of splendour
with their French neighbours, yet so powerful
were their propensities for pleasure, and every species
of amusement, that they devoted but little of
their time to the improvement of their properties,
and they obtained from them but little beyond a
scanty supply for their own immediate wants. From
every source of information that can be consulted,
it appears that the Spaniards, from their earliest
settlement down to the period when they finally
quitted the country, depended more on their mines
than on anything that possibly could be derived
from either agriculture or commerce; consequently
agriculture was in a backward state, and the culture
of the soil made but a very slow progress: indeed,
but a very small proportion of the country was in a
state of tillage; the inhabitants merely paid a little
attention to the natural pastures which abounded in
all the plains of the east, and whose luxuriance and
verdure continued throughout the whole year. In
these they raised large herds of cattle, for which
they found a market, not only among their neighbours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
the French, who required a considerable supply
for their estates, but they exported very large
quantities to Jamaica and Cuba. To the raising
of cattle, therefore, and to the occasional cutting
of wood&mdash;mahogany, cedar, and a variety of other
timbers for ornamental work, as well as dye-woods,&mdash;did
the Spaniards devote their time, and hence
did they contrive to satisfy their moderate and contracted
wants, without having recourse to tillage.</p>

<p>It has been observed, and I think very truly,
that the most important obstacle to the advancement
of this part of Hayti, was the policy pursued
by Spain towards her colonies. The system
of government under which she ruled her transatlantic
settlements seems to have been one of extreme
oppression, and of unexampled rigour, and,
from the earliest period of her sway, this system
was most rigidly enforced in Hispañeola. There
does not appear upon record any circumstance previously
to the year 1700, which evinced a disposition
on the part of Spain to promote the welfare of the
colony, by calling forth its local resources, and by
encouraging and tolerating settlers from others of
their unprofitable and barren islands, in which all
their energies and efforts had been fruitless and unavailing.
The high state of the west end, under
their prudent and more assiduous neighbours the
French, whose industry and perseverance had astonished
the world, and whose judicious and highly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
commendable system for promoting the cultivation
of their country had become the theme of much
praise and admiration, seemed about this time to
have produced among the Spaniards some disposition
to adopt measures for insuring to the parent
state a more lucrative trade from their colonies.
The force of example was too powerful to be resisted,
and even the Court of Madrid began about this
time to devise measures which might improve, and
which might call into play all those resources which
this highly fertile and most congenial soil was known
to possess. Governors of known prudence and patriotic
zeal for the interest of their nation were selected,
and sent out, with injunctions to promote the interests
of agriculture, and to give a spur to commerce,
by opening an intercourse with their neighbours.
The wants of the French in cattle, mules, and horses,
were exceedingly extensive, and offered to the Spaniards
an opportunity of improving their properties,
by providing a vent for the sale of their stock. It
gave an impulse to industry, and the once inert and
unconcerned Spanish planter became in time an
active and enterprising agriculturist, shaking off
that languor by which he had been previously characterized,
and at length assuming a degree of animation
and spirit, which enabled him to take advantage
of those resources which nature had placed
within his reach.</p>

<p>A mutual interchange and good understanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
between the two powers of France and Spain having
taken place, this intercourse, become more frequent
and reciprocally beneficial, continued for a series of
years. In 1790, however, this most important branch
of their commerce was cut off by the convulsion into
which the neighbouring province was thrown. All
that part of the population who dwelt on the
frontiers withdrew themselves into the interior, leaving
behind them their cattle, which fell into the
hands of their rapacious neighbours, whose inroads
caused much consternation amongst the proprietors;
but their slaves, from habit or from some
other powerful cause, remained unmoved and attached
to them, although they had before them such
strong incentives to revolt. Every appeal made by
these people (and it is said, that they made innumerable
ones) to the cabinet of Spain for protection
against the fatal example of the French division,
met with a very cold reception, if not a positive
rejection. In this state of suspense and continued
fear and alarm the people remained, until
the disgraceful treaty of Basle gave Hispañeola to
the republican government of France; and this
event I cannot better describe than in the language
of one of the most correct writers on this country<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>,
whom I shall here quote as an authority which has
been hitherto deemed unquestionable. Speaking of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
this event, which occurred in the year 1795, and of
the designs of the French rulers, he says, “though
busied in the plans of universal dominion on their
own continent, their cabinet did not lose sight or
cease to entertain a hope of again possessing colonies
abroad, and they were well aware which were the
most desirable. Perhaps no system of invasion
had been longer or more deeply premeditated, and
digested with more mysterious secrecy, than the
entire subjugation of Spain and her American settlements,
in which, besides the common views of
aggrandizement, their constitutional enmity to the
reigning family acted as a powerful stimulus. This
policy was coeval with that ambition which marked
the first career of the present ruler of France and
the specious veil under which the hidden, but continued
advances were regularly made towards the
end in view, adds to the guilt of duplicity and ingratitude,
when we consider that Spain has scrupulously
maintained her treaty of alliance and has fulfilled
the stipulations entered into in 1795, notwithstanding
all the three changes that have given
other names to the French government, without altering
its entity, or revolutionary or destructive
system; that the cabinets of Madrid have bended
to a degree of abject condescension, rather than be
precipitated into a war; that they have sacrificed
the interests and inclinations of their people, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
have been driven at length into a state of non-reprisal,
rather than risk a warfare with a nation they
respected, and though an ally, furnishing both men
and money under promises to share in the conquests
made, they have been treated rather as a faithless
neutral without claim, representation, or character,
and thus their country has been impoverished and
laid waste, and the supports of national union and
energy undermined.”</p>

<p>Further, in continuation of this disgraceful treaty,
by which Spain so abjectly submitted to surrender
her colony to France, he says, “by this instrument of
diplomatic intrigue and subtlety Hispañeola was made
over unreservedly to France; the oldest subjects of
the Spanish crown in the western world were thus
bartered like so many sheep, and an island, not the
capture of an enemy during war, and given up at its
termination, but one that had descended to them as a
primitive right, and had formed the glory of the preceding
monarchs, who saw it discovered and settled.
When possession was given in further aggravation
of the Spanish natives, the transfer was received by
Toussaint at the head of the intrusive settlers of one
division of the island, with whom the former had
previously and generously shared their territory;
in short by a horde of emancipated slaves to whom
the French republic had given equality, consistence,
and power, and who now came to erect a new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
standard on the spot consecrated by the labours and
ashes of Columbus, and long revered as an object of
national pride.”</p>

<p>“In justice to the Dominican people it may be
said, that none of the Spanish settlements possess
more of the amor patriæ which ought to distinguish
loyal subjects: they received the news as a thunder-bolt,
and the country presented an universal scene
of lamentation. They appealed to the humanity
of their sovereign, but without effect, and then had
recourse to remonstrances.”</p>

<p>Receiving no answer to their prayers or to their
remonstrances, the people were left in a state bordering
on despondency, with the only alternative
of leaving their native land, or of swearing allegiance
to a power in whom they could not confide,
and which they had been taught to detest. Emigration
therefore was determined on, and all orders&mdash;nuns,
friars, clergy, and men of property and influence&mdash;with
their families and their slaves, embarked
for Cuba, Porto Rico, and the Spanish main,
leaving behind them their possessions, to seek a
shelter, and to find homes and occupations, in a
country in which they might be protected by laws
to which they had been accustomed, and submit
to a government which they had been taught to respect.
The extent of this emigration was considerable,
and is said to have amounted to one third of the
population; and it is evident from a subsequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
census that this was not an exaggeration, and that
so large a proportion of the people absolutely left
the country, abandoning their abodes and much
wealth rather than submit to a people whom they
hated as the usurpers of their possessions.</p>

<p>In the years 1789 and 1790, about which time the
first disturbances among the slaves in the French part
of the island commenced, it appears the Spanish division
contained about one hundred and fifty thousand
souls or upwards; but by a subsequent census taken
immediately after the cession to the French, and after
the spirit for emigration had in some measure subsided,
there remained only about one hundred thousand
of all descriptions, a very strong proof of the
detestation in which the Spaniards held this treaty,
which assigned them over as subjects of the republican
government of France. It is very evident,
however, whatever impressions this arrangement
might have made on the Spanish colonists, that it was
one dictated by the rulers in France, and therefore accepted
from necessity, and not from choice. The
infamous Godoy, Prince of Peace (which high sounding
title was confirmed by this treaty) was the leading
personage in its negotiation, and being secretly
leagued with the French ministry, became a willing
instrument in consigning this bright and valuable
appendage of the Spanish crown to the more
designing and crafty schemes of the French cabinet,
which had been from the beginning of their ambitious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
aim at universal dominion, not unmindful of
the advantages that were to be derived from colonial
possessions. When it is seen that the mistaken
and weak policy, as well as the pusillanimity of the
Spanish cabinet, caused so great a sacrifice as the
dismemberment of their most valuable colony, it becomes
a matter of no astonishment that the people
should relax in their efforts to aid the means and
resources of their parent state, by any exertions, in
the cultivation of their lands, beyond what might be
requisite for their own support. As this neglect and
heedless inattention to their prosperity had been
for a series of years observable, and as every incentive
to industry was checked by the measures of the
crown, it is not to be wondered at that this division
of the island did not advance at the same rate as
that which was under the dominion of France.
However manifest the declension of the colony was to
Spain, she never made any movements, nor adopted
any means indicating a desire to revive the drooping
energies of the colonists, and reinstate them in
their former easy circumstances and affluence. If
the cabinet of Madrid had had recourse to those
wise plans which would have promoted the cause of
agriculture and commerce, instead of becoming a
calm and unconcerned spectator of the decline of
both, this colony might still have remained the most
brilliant gem in the Spanish crown. A people who
had, from the example of their neighbours, and by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
an impulse the most surprising, been roused from a
state of lethargy and inactivity to great exertions in
the culture of the soil, in the breeding of cattle, and
in commercial enterprise, might have exalted their
country to the highest possible state of prosperity,
had their efforts been seconded by the regulations
of a wise government, and had that protection been
given to them to which they were surely entitled; but
instead of such support and protection, instead of
being watched over and guarded by their parent
state, their prayers, their petitions, and entreaties,
were unattended to, and they were given up as a
prey to their rebellious and uncivilized neighbours,
who used every exertion to throw their country into
a state of anarchy and confusion. The individual
and unsupported energies of the colonists, however,
were roused by the alarming predicament into which
they had been thrown, through the apathy and supineness
of the cabinet of Spain, and they effectually
stopped the incursions of the pillagers for a
time, prevented the destruction of their towns and
plantations, and finally, by their firmness and perseverance,
saved their properties from the devastations
which had destroyed those of the western division.</p>

<p>To the astonishment of the world, the slaves, as I
have before remarked, adhered with extraordinary
fidelity to the cause of their masters, and evinced
no disposition to become participators in the work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
of rebellion, nor to enrich themselves by the spoils
obtained by plunder, rapine, and every kind of predatory
warfare. Although the example to throw off
the yoke of slavery was constantly before them, few
were the instances in which a slave joined the insurgents.
Such an attachment on the part of the
slave towards his master, however, is not to be wondered
at, when it is known, that the Spaniards were
kind, indulgent, and liberal owners, always attentive
to their wants, and alive to their comforts; seldom
inflicting punishment, except for flagrant acts of insubordination
and theft, but treating them with a leniency
and humanity which softened the rigours of
slavery, and left it to be known only by name.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the enmity which always existed
between the two colonies, a smuggling trade was
carried on, which, although not very extensive, was
exceedingly productive to the Spaniards, as it took
off part of their horned cattle, mules, horses, &amp;c.,
and in return for which they received the products
and manufactures of Europe, and slaves, which they
could not obtain by the regular course of importation,
on any thing like the same moderate or favourable
terms. It is stated, that the French purchased
annually upwards of twenty-five thousand head of
horned cattle and about two thousand five hundred
mules and horses; and that the Spaniards also
transmitted upwards of half a million of dollars in
specie during the year, for the purchase of goods,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
implements of agriculture, and negroes. Large
shipments of mahogany and dye-woods found their
way to Spain and different parts of Europe, and the
United States, and indirectly to England: and a
considerable intercourse existed with the islands of
Porto Rico, Cuba, and Jamaica, to which latter two
islands cattle were exported, and mahogany and
dye-woods found a market in Jamaica more advantageous
than any that could be found in Europe,
owing to their being able to procure their returns in
a more direct way than through the mother-country
or any of the European states.</p>

<p>The commerce with Porto Rico and the Spanish
main was also productive of some profit to the people
of St. Domingo. The advantages accruing to
the former arose from the facilities of smuggling, by
which the enormous duties on foreign European
goods of thirty-four per cent. in most cases were
saved; and these goods could be purchased in St.
Domingo on more moderate terms, from having
been illicitly obtained from the French part of the
island.</p>

<p>The trade to the United States was also of no
little importance; for the vessels of that country
took large quantities of mahogany, hides, some coffee,
and a little dye-wood, in return for the cargoes
which they brought thither, consisting of flour, beef,
pork, butter, salted herrings, and dried cod-fish,
with some East India goods, and various descriptions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
of lumber of America, more useful and easy
in working for buildings than the hard wood of the
country. The aggregate value of the exports and
imports of this part of the island I have seen nowhere
correctly stated: it is very evident, however,
from the various accounts which I have seen, that it
was infinitely less than the aggregate of the French
part; and this may be safely confided in from the
extremely fertile state of the one, when compared
with the uncultivated condition of the other; from
the industrious, the assiduous, and enterprising spirit,
so characteristic of the French colonist, aided
by the judicious measures of the cabinet of France,
which sought to protect and encourage the agriculture
and commerce of her colonies, whilst the Spaniards
of the eastern division were left to pursue
both their agricultural and commercial avocations
under every species of discouragement and restraint.
The energy displayed by one government, and the
very relaxed system pursued by the other, accounts
for the flourishing state of one part of this rich colony,
whilst its rival was steeped in poverty: nothing,
therefore, is left for conjecture as to the
cause of so great a contrast; and both having subsequently
been shaken by the effects of those pernicious
doctrines so generally propagated at the Revolution,
little is to be seen of the antecedent state
of either, and chaos, ignorance, and indolence have
superseded order, light, and industry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>Such was the state of the island at and during the
two or three succeeding years of the revolution, as
related by several writers, and confirmed by information
obtained from individuals now residing in the
country, who were present during the troubles which
agitated and destroyed it, and reduced them from
the height of affluence and peace into misery, and
oftentimes into want&mdash;from them, much, of course,
was to be elicited; and although I thought it a
matter of prudence and a necessary caution, not to
rely too implicitly on their communications, yet I
always found them justly entitled to my confidence,
on the fullest investigation. I never had a cause to
question their veracity. Their account of the
scenes which took place during the early stages and
progress of the revolution, accords with the statements
of others who have described them, and I
have not been able to discover any discrepances between
them.</p>

<p class="pch">Cause of the revolution in the colony.&mdash;People of colour
in France.&mdash;Their proceedings.&mdash;League with the
society of Amis des Noirs.&mdash;Ogé’s rebellion.&mdash;His defeat
and death.&mdash;Conduct of the proprietors and planters.&mdash;Consequences
of it.</p>

<p class="pn2"><span class="smcap">It</span> has been very erroneously thought by some persons,
who feel interested in the fate of the slave
population of the West Indies, or at all events they
have, with no little industry, propagated the impression,
that the revolution in Hayti begun with the
revolt of the blacks, when it is evident, from the
very best authors and from the testimony of people
now living, who were present during its opening
scenes, that such was not the fact, and that the
slaves remained perfectly tranquil for two years after
the celebrated “Declaration of Rights” was promulgated
in France. Such persons give themselves
but little trouble in searching the history of the
island&mdash;they are satisfied with the report of others,
who may be equally uninformed with themselves; and
thus it is that they imbibe ideas and notions of the
wonderful capacities of the negro population, who
could have commenced, and so effectually carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
themselves through a struggle for freedom, without,
as they allege, the aid of any other more enlightened
or more powerful auxiliary. It requires no observation
of mine to shew that the first symptom of disorder
shewed itself among that class of people in
the colony denominated, at the time, Sang-mêlées,
or Gens de Couleur, or, as termed in the British colonies,
mulattoes, who from their numbers formed a
very powerful body, and not being countenanced
by the whites, became in time inveterately opposed
to them: many of them, natives of the colony and of
the other French islands, were residing in France at
the time of the Revolution, and these consisted of
persons who had been sent thither in early life for
their education, together with others who possessed
considerable property, as well as some talent and
intelligence. At this period also, from an extraordinary
prejudice that prevailed in France against
the inhabitants of the colonies, arising from an
aversion to the principles of slavery, and which was
much encouraged by the denunciation against everything
having the least appearance of despotism, a
society was established, denominated “Amis des
Noirs” (Friends of the Blacks), which aimed at the
subversion of the government, and called for an immediate
abolition of the slave-trade, as well as a
general emancipation of all those who were at the
time living in a state of slavery.</p>

<p>“With these people” (meaning the men of colour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
in France), says a writer on this subject, “the society
of Amis des Noirs formed an intimate connection.
Their personal appearance excited pity, and,
cooperating with the spirit of the times and the
representations of those who deeply sympathized
upon principles of humanity with their condition,
all ranks of people became clamorous against the
white colonists, and their total annihilation was
threatened.” Not long after the formation of this
union of feeling and sentiment between the friends
of the blacks and the men of colour in France, the
national assembly promulgated their famous declaration
of rights, an act certainly contemplating the
destruction of all order, and having an evident tendency
to excite the lower classes of the people into
every species of insubordination and general ferment;
one of its leading and most important clauses
being, that “<i>all men are born and continue free
and equal as to their rights</i>.”</p>

<p>The society of Amis des Noirs, aided by a corresponding
institution in London, together with the
united body of the coloured people in France, lost no
time in sending out this very celebrated declaration,
and in disseminating its principles throughout the
whole island; their efforts were not unavailing, for
the mulattoes, conscious that the French nation
were favourable towards their designs of demanding
a restitution of their rights, and the full and unqualified
enjoyment of those privileges hitherto confined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
to the white colonists, had recourse to arms,
and appeared in bodies for the purpose of awing the
provincial assemblies into concession; but their number
not being great, they were in the onset easily
subdued. It is said, however, that notwithstanding
this check to their progress, the assemblies were
much disposed to concede to the demands of the
mulattoes; but in no instance could they think of
permitting those white inhabitants to participate in
these privileges, who had in any way cooperated
with them. Several of the civil officers of the colony
and magistrates declaimed against slavery, and
openly avowed themselves supporters of the declaration
of the national assembly of the mother-country;
they were arrested by the provincial assemblies,
and committed to prison, and such was the irritation
and fury of the mob, that Mons. Beaudierre, a
respectable magistrate at Petit Goane, was taken out
by force, and, in spite of the municipality and other
powers, put to death. In some cases the governor
successfully interposed, and those who were most
obnoxious to the people were conveyed out of the colony
by secret means. During all these outrages, there
is no account upon record of the negroes taking any
part, and the fact seems to be established, that at
this period they were quite tranquil and unmoved,
although their several proprietors were concerned
either for or against the measures from which the
agitations sprung.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>It appears that the governor of the colony had
lost a great deal of his popularity, and consequently
of his power, by his interposition; for a general colonial
assembly, convoked in January 1790 by
order from the king, determined that his instructions
were imperfect and inapplicable, and the people
therefore proceeded on a plan of their own, and
changed both the time and the place at which the
assembly should be held. Nothing could have
emanated from the deliberations of the body convoked
by this determination of the people, for the
discontented and confused state of the colony being
soon known in the mother-country, and an apprehension
having arisen that the island was likely
soon to be declared independent, the national assembly,
in March 1790, came to the following decision:
“That it never was the intention of the assembly
to comprehend the interior government of
the colonies in the constitution which they had
framed for the mother-country, or to subject them
to laws which were incompatible with their local
establishments; they therefore authorize the inhabitants
of each colony to signify to the national assembly
their sentiments and wishes concerning the
plan of interior legislation and commercial arrangement
which would be most conducive to their prosperity.”
Then followed a resolution, “That the
national assembly would not cause any innovation
to be made, directly or indirectly, in any system of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
commerce in which the colonies were already concerned.”<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>The people of colour and the society of Amis
des Noirs were, as it might have been anticipated,
thrown into considerable alarm by the promulgation
of a decree of so ambiguous a character, and no
little surprise and consternation followed its appearance
in the island. It was construed into an acquiescence
in the further continuance of the slave-trade;
it was also conceived to confer upon the
colonists the power of settling and affixing their colonial
constitutions, and to absolve them from their
allegiance to the French crown.</p>

<p>The first general assembly of the island which
was convoked after these decrees had been received,
and had excited the astonishment of the people,
was held at St. Marc on the 16th of April 1790.
Their deliberative functions commenced with a discussion
upon the hardships to which the people of
colour were subjected under the military system of
the colony, and it was determined, that on no subsequent
occasion should they be required to perform
more duty than was usually exacted from the
whites.</p>

<p>An inquiry into the abuses alleged to prevail in
the colonial courts of judicature, and the discussion
of a new plan of colonial government, were the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
principal subjects which occupied the attention of
the assembly until the end of May, when it was adjourned
or prorogued.</p>

<p>M. Paynier was at this time governor-general of
St. Domingo: he had neither the capacity nor the
disposition required for administering the affairs of
the colony at such a period. Instead of being actuated
with the desire of conciliating the parties
opposed to each other, he secretly gave every possible
aid and encouragement to the supporters of
ancient despotism. The appearance of Colonel
Mauduit, however, a man of some talent and energy,
effected a change; for he soon acquired much influence
over the governor-general, and prevented the
coalition which was about to take place between the
assembly and the mulattoes; and declaring himself
the protector of the latter, he speedily gained over to
his interest the greater part of that class of people.
The planters at this time, too, were in an undecided
state, wavering in their opinions, and fixed to no
measures likely to preserve the tranquillity of the
island, and there was not one of their body capable
of impressing them with a due sense of the condition
into which they were likely to be precipitated
by their want of energy and decision. Forming as
they did a numerous class of the inhabitants, had
they been unanimous in their opinions, and united
in their views, the repose of the colony would in all
probability have been preserved. Such not being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
the case, however, and some of the provincial assemblies
making efforts to counteract the measures
of the general one, a civil war seemed likely to be
the result of so much diversity of sentiment. The
decree of the general colonial assembly of the 28th
of May was indicative of an approaching convulsion,
which before long might be expected to burst
forth; the preamble to this decree exhibited sentiments
which seemed to breathe a spirit hostile to
the peace of the people. The articles themselves
assume it as a branch of the prerogative of the
crown to confirm or annul the acts of the colonial
legislature at pleasure. These articles are important,
and I shall detail them as they have been given
by others.</p>

<p>“First. The legislative authority, in every thing
which relates to the internal concerns of the colony
(régime interieur), is vested in the assembly of its
representatives, which shall be called ‘The General
Assembly of the French Part of St. Domingo.’</p>

<p>“Secondly. No act of the legislative body, in
what relates to the internal concerns of the colony,
shall be considered <i>as a law definitive</i>, unless it may
be made by the representatives of the French part
of St. Domingo, freely and legally chosen, and confirmed
by the king.</p>

<p>“Thirdly. In cases of urgent necessity, a legislative
decree of the general assembly, in what relates
to the internal concerns of the colony, shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
be considered as a law provisional. In all such
cases the decree shall be notified forthwith to the
governor-general, who, within ten days after such
notification, shall cause it to be published and enforced,
or transmit to the general assembly his observations
thereon.</p>

<p>“Fourthly. The necessity of the case, on which
the execution of such provisional decree is to depend,
shall be a separate question, and be carried in
the affirmative by a majority of two-thirds of the
general assembly; the names and numbers being
taken down (prises par l’appel nominal).</p>

<p>“Fifthly. If the governor-general shall send
down his observations on any such decree, the same
shall be entered in the journals of the general assembly,
who shall then proceed to revise the decree,
and consider the observations thereon, in three several
sittings. The votes for confirming or annulling
the decree shall be given in the words Yes or
No, and a minute of the proceedings shall be signed
by the members present, in which shall be enumerated
the votes on each side of the question, and if
there appears a majority of two-thirds for confirming
the decree, it shall be immediately enforced by the
governor-general.</p>

<p>“Sixthly. As every law ought to be founded on
the consent of those who are to be bound by it, the
French part of St. Domingo shall be allowed to
propose regulations concerning commercial arrangements,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
and the system of mutual connexion (rapports
commerciaux, et autres rapports communs),
and the decrees which the national assembly shall
make in all such cases, <i>shall not be enforced in the
colony, until the general assembly shall have consented
thereto</i>.</p>

<p>“Seventhly. In cases of pressing necessity, the
importation of articles for the support of the inhabitants
shall not be considered as any breach of the
system of commercial regulations between St. Domingo
and France; provided that the decrees to be
made in such cases by the general assembly shall be
submitted to the revision of the governor-general,
under the same conditions and modifications as are
prescribed in articles three and five.</p>

<p>“Eighthly. Provided also, that every legislative
act of the general assembly executed provisionally,
in cases of urgent necessity, shall be transmitted
forthwith for the royal sanction. And if the king
shall refuse his consent to any such act, its execution
shall be suspended as soon as the king’s refusal
shall be legally notified to the general assembly.</p>

<p>“Ninthly. A new general assembly shall be
chosen every two years, and none of the members
who have served in the former assembly shall be
eligible in the new one.</p>

<p>“Tenthly. The general assembly decree that the
preceding articles, as forming part of the constitution
of the French colony in St. Domingo, shall be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
immediately transmitted to France for the acceptance
of the national assembly and the king. They
shall likewise be transmitted to all the parishes and
districts of the colony, and be notified to the governor-general.”</p>

<p>It was not likely that a decree, the articles of
which were thus opposed to the maintenance of
order, could exact the acquiescence and submission
of the people, and lead them to an approval of that
which seemed to aim at the destruction of all subordination.
Serious apprehensions arose as to the
measures which would be adopted and pursued at
this juncture, to avert the impending storm which
was expected at no distant period to burst forth.</p>

<p>It was imagined, and was a received opinion, that
the “declaring of the colony an independent state,
in imitation of the English American provinces”,
was certain, and every effort was made to avert such
a proceeding. No obedience to the general assembly
could be enforced. The inhabitants of Cape
François were the first to set the example of renouncing
all respect for that body, and of calling
upon the governor-general to dissolve them. With
this request he instantly complied, charging the
general assembly with a design of undermining the
peace of the colony, by forming projects of independency,
contrary to the voice of the colonists; he
even charged them with having been accessories or
instigators of the mutiny of the crew of one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
king’s ships, and pronouncing them traitors to their
king and country, he declared that he should take
the most prompt and effective measures for bringing
them to that punishment for which their treachery
so loudly called.</p>

<p>An attempt was made to arrest the committee of
the western provincial assembly, and a force under
M. Mauduit was sent for that purpose, but he failed
in effecting his object, for the members, hearing of
his approach, collected about four hundred of the
national guard for their defence, and M. Mauduit
retired after a skirmish or two, without any other
advantage than the capture of the national colours.</p>

<p>The general assembly being apprised of this attack,
immediately summoned the people to the support
and protection of their representatives. The
northern provincial assembly adhered to the governor-general,
and, to oppose the progress of his opponents,
they sent him all the troops stationed in
that quarter, together with an additional force of
about two hundred mulattoes. The western province
collected a much greater force, and everything
seemed to indicate a sanguinary civil war,
when an event occurred which for a time averted all
those unhappy results that would inevitably have
taken place, had the opposing parties come in contact.</p>

<p>Most unexpectedly, at this momentous juncture,
for the purpose of trying the effect of a personal appeal
to the national assembly of France, the general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
assembly of the island determined on a voyage to
Europe. About one hundred members, all that remained
of their body, from the effects of sickness
and desertion, embarked on board the Leopard (that
very ship, the crew of which had declared themselves
in their interest a very short time previously)
on the 8th of August, and took their departure,
hailed with the warmest acclamations of the populace,
who could not restrain their admiration at so
extraordinary an act of devotion to the good of their
country. It is said, that “tears of sensibility and
affection were shed at their departure by all classes
of people, and the parties in arms appeared mutually
disposed to submit their differences to the king and
the national assembly.”</p>

<p>Immediately after this storm had subsided, every
effort was made by the governor-general, Paynier,
to restore confidence and tranquillity amongst the
people, and for some time, there was a strong indication
of the peace of the colony being once more
established; but the designs of the people of colour
in France, abetted by the society of Amis des Noirs,
at the head of which were some of the most violent
of the revolutionary characters of France, destroyed
all their hopes, and every species of anarchy and
confusion was anticipated from the proceedings of
these disseminators of the pernicious doctrine of
equality and the rights of man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>It was at this period that the first mulatto rebellion
took place, at the head of which was the famous
Ogé, the protegé and disciple of La Fayette and
Robespierre, a young man about thirty years of age,
and a native of the northern part of St. Domingo.
He had been educated in France at the expense
of his mother, a woman of property living near
Cape François; having been admitted to the
meetings of the society of Amis des Noirs, he had
imbibed all their principles, and had become enthusiastic
in demanding an equality of rights and privileges
for his coloured brethren. Encouraged by
the society, and the revolutionary leaders, he left
France for the purpose of instigating his fellow colonists
of colour to take up arms in the assertion of
their claims. To give him something like an appearance
of military command, the society purchased
for him the rank of lieutenant-colonel in the army of
one of the German states. To conceal his designs
from the king and the national assembly, he made a
circuitous voyage by North America; but his object
was known before he left France, and intimation
was sent out to the governor-general that he had
embarked for St. Domingo, and that his scheme was
to excite his coloured brethren to arms. A description
of his person, and I believe a portrait also, were
transmitted for the better discovery of him on his
arrival; but notwithstanding every precaution, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
landed secretly, and the circumstance remained unknown,
until some weeks afterwards he wrote to the
governor, reviling him for his proceedings, and in the
name of all the mulattoes, of which he declared
himself to be the protector, demanding in the most
contumelious language the immediate execution of
all the statutes of the Code Noir, and that in all times
to come there should be no distinction, as to rights
and privileges, between the whites and the other
inhabitants of the island. To give a greater force
as he thought to his demand, he vauntingly stated,
that unless the governor-general acceded to his propositions,
he should assert them by the force of arms.
Ogé, however, was somewhat premature in his calculations
of support and aid in the carrying into effect
the object of his voyage; for although some considerable
time had elapsed from his landing, and he
had the assistance of his brothers, who were tainted
with the same love of insubordination and tumult, he
never could collect at any one time more than from
two to three hundred to join him in his cause. He
encamped his followers near the Grand Rivière, and
it is said, that his brothers and another chief, Chevane,
instigated their people to commit many excesses,
and at times murdered the unoffending inhabitants
in the vicinity, with the most shocking
cruelty, whenever they declined to join in their proceedings.
Instances were many, in which whole
families were murdered, from the circumstance of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
father, or even a brother, refusing to take up arms
to favour their cause.</p>

<p>Supported by so small a body, and no simultaneous
movement taking place in any other part of
the colony, the career of Ogé and his associates was
not likely to be of any long duration. Steps were
immediately taken by the governor to suppress the
revolt, and to bring the leaders to trial, if it were
found practicable to apprehend them. Troops and
the Cape militia were sent to oppose them, when a
skirmish ensued in which many of the rebels fell,
and some were taken prisoners. Ogé escaped with
Chevane; but as it was known that they had fled
into the Spanish territory, they were demanded by
the successor of Peynier, M. Blanchelande (the
former having resigned his command, and embarked
for Europe,) who brought them to trial in
March 1791, and they were condemned: Ogé and
Chevane to be broken on the wheel, and his brother
and some of his followers to be hanged. The fortitude
of Chevane never forsook him to the last,
and he met his fate with extraordinary resolution
and courage; but Ogé exhibited the greatest pusillanimity,
supplicating in the most abject manner
that mercy might be extended to him. It appears
that a respite was granted to him, in consideration
of his promise to make the most important discoveries
were his life spared. He made a full confession
before commissioners appointed for that purpose,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
and in that confession was detailed the whole
plan which the coloured people had devised to excite
the negro population to open rebellion.</p>

<p>It seemed a case of peculiar hardship, if not of
great injustice, and breach of all faith and honour,
that after the unfortunate and deluded man had
made such important disclosures, and had informed
the governor of the whole of their designs, by
which their further progress might be defeated, his
life should be sacrificed; mercy having been held
out as the price of his confession, it should have
been extended to him, for this he had unquestionably,
upon every principle of justice, a right to expect
and to demand. Why it should not have been
granted to him, no reason has been assigned. He
was executed immediately after, and at the fatal
spot he shewed neither the firmness, fortitude, nor
the mind of a brave man suffering in that cause of
which he had been the leader.</p>

<p>The proceedings of the government with respect
to the revolt of Ogé, and the very unjust execution
of the latter, excited great animosity between the
whites and the people of colour, the latter of whom
had collected in large bodies in various parts. In
the western and southern districts they formed encampments,
and displayed a determination to resist
the oppression and the unjust decrees of the governor.
At Jeremie, and at Aux Cayes in particular,
a most formidable body had collected, well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
armed and accoutred, and shewed a great desire to
come in contact with the government troops. It
has been generally admitted that Mauduit, who
commanded the troops of the government, was in
secret conference with their leaders, and that on
several occasions he appeared among them singly,
and consulted with them, advising them not to desist
from their purpose, but to move forward with
energy and perseverance. That he did this traitorously,
is evident, for having obtained intelligence of
the whole of their plans through this ruse, he availed
himself of it for the purpose of defeating them, and
as it afterwards turned out, the mulattoes were dispersed
and obliged to seek refuge in any place where
it was not likely that they could be known or discovered.</p>

<p>The members of the colonial assembly who had
gone to France for the purpose of laying their complaints
at the foot of the throne, were not received
with much favour; on the contrary, having appeared
at the bar of the national assembly they were
dismissed with considerable disappointment and
chagrin. The report of the committee appointed
to examine their claims, displays no little disapprobation
of the proceedings of the general colonial assembly.
It concludes by saying, “that all the pretended
decrees and acts of the said colonial assembly
should be reversed and pronounced utterly null and
of no effect; that the said assembly should be declared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
dissolved, and its members rendered ineligible
and incapable of being delegated in future to
the colonial assembly of St. Domingo; that testimonies
of approbation should be transmitted to the
northern provincial assembly, to Colonel Mauduit
and the regiment of Port-au-Prince, for resisting the
proceedings at St. Marc’s; that the king should be
requested to give orders for the forming a new colonial
assembly on the principles of the national decree
of the 8th of March 1790, and instructions of
the 28th of the same month; finally, that the cidevant
members, then in France, should continue in
a state of arrest, until the national assembly might
find time to signify its further pleasure concerning
them.”</p>

<p>Nothing could exceed the consternation which this
decree excited throughout the colony, and the indignation
of the people was manifest from one extremity
of it to the other. To have called another general
colonial assembly would have been an act of impossibility,
for the people in many districts absolutely
refused to return other representatives, declaring
those that were under arrest in France to be the only
legal ones, and that they would not proceed to another
election.</p>

<p>The national guards, who had for some time felt,
with no little mortification, the insult offered them by
Mauduit, who had previously carried off their colours,
evinced a disposition to resent the affront,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
and to refuse all further adherence to the cause in
which they had enlisted; and they were soon after
joined in their revolt by the very regiment of which
Mauduit was the commander, tearing the white
cockade from their hats, and indignantly refusing
obedience to him. Discovering the error into which
he had fallen, he offered to restore the national colours,
and appealed to them for protection against
insult, which these faithless wretches pledged. But
because he would not <i>stoop to the humiliation of
begging pardon of the national guards on his
knees</i>, he was, notwithstanding this pledge, on the
day appointed for the ceremony of restoring the colours,
suddenly pierced by the bayonets of those
very soldiers whom on innumerable occasions he
had so kindly and so liberally treated. The other
troops who happened to be present at this most dastardly
and inhuman act, could not witness it without
an attempt to revenge themselves on the perpetrators;
they were however restrained from effecting
their intention, and only compelled them to lay
down their arms, when they were sent off prisoners
to France, there to receive that punishment which
such an enormity most justly deserved.</p>

<p>About this period the accounts of the fatal end of
Ogé had arrived in Paris, an event that caused an
amazing sensation amongst the advocates of the
people of colour and the society of Amis des Noirs;
it brought forward the Abbe Gregoire, the staunch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
friend of the former, who, with extraordinary eloquence
and great warmth, claimed the benefit which
the instructions of March 1790 gave to them. After
a violent address from Robespierre, who said,
“Perish the colonies rather than sacrifice one iota
of our principles”, the national assembly confirmed
the decree of the 15th of May, 1791, which enacted,
“that the people of colour resident in the French
colonies should be allowed the privileges of French
citizens, and, among others, those of having votes
in the choice of representatives, and of being eligible
to seats both in the parochial and colonial assemblies.”</p>

<p>This decree, on being received in the colony, excited
no little sensation; the greatest indignation
was manifested by the white people in every quarter,
but still they refrained from acts of hostility to the
measures of the mother-country, under the hope
that when the new colonial assembly, which was to
meet at Leogane on the 9th of August, entered
upon its legislative functions, it would without
doubt afford them that redress which they so anxiously
desired.</p>

<p>The mulattoes, no doubt, expected that a most
serious opposition would be given to this decree, as
the governor, M. Blanchelande, had assured the
provincial assembly of the north, “that he would
suspend the execution of this obnoxious decree whenever
it should come to him properly authenticated”;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
they accordingly assembled in large bodies throughout
the whole colony, and displayed a determination
to enforce by arms the concession of those privileges
to which, under the decree of the national assembly,
they asserted they were entitled.</p>

<p>Here, it will be perceived, the first serious symptoms
of tumult and insubordination appeared, not
from any revolt of the slave population, but from
the unhappy interference of the national assembly
of France, influenced by the supporters and advocates
of the people of colour, and the society of
Amis des Noirs. Had this interference been declined
by the mother-country, and had the colonial assembly
been invested with the sole legislative power of
framing regulations for the internal government of
the island, all those lamentable scenes which subsequently
followed would have been averted, and the
colony would have preserved its peace and repose,
and have proceeded on, in its highly rich and cultivated
condition, to the great advantage of the proprietors,
to the enhancement of the revenues of the
parent state, and without, in any way, oppressing the
slave cultivators or increasing the burthens under
which they were said to labour.</p>

<p>At the period of this narrative to which we have
now arrived, the effects of the Revolution in France
had made a very sensible impression on the whites,
as well as on the people of colour; and it has been
a matter of no little astonishment, that during the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
disputes which so unhappily existed, and whilst the
adherents of one party were committing acts of hostility
against the other, the slave population should
have remained passive observers of the contest between
their respective masters, and in no instance,
I believe, did they fly to their succour and support.
The proprietors and planters of all denominations
had arrived at a very high state of affluence, their
plantations were extensive, in a high state of cultivation;
thus possessing a soil rich and productive
in a climate particularly favourable for cultivation,
their wealth scarcely knew any limits. But unfortunately
their manners and habits became relaxed
and depraved in proportion as they advanced in affluence
and prosperity. Proud, austere, and voluptuous,
they often committed acts which humanity
must condemn; and in the season of agitation and
disappointment, when the contending factions at
home and abroad were endeavouring to undermine
them, they perhaps were led to the infliction of excessive
punishments, and to practise an unusual degree
of severity in exacting labour from their slaves.
Sensual pleasures had also, at this time, become so
prevalent as to excite very general disgust.</p>

<p>The mass of society had become so depraved, that
vice in every shape was gloried in, whilst virtue was
scarcely known; it cannot therefore be a matter of
much surprise, that the rude, untaught, and unlettered
slave, just emerging from his savage customs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
should be led by example to imbibe the vicious habits,
and indulge the loose and ungovernable propensities
which characterized his master. Upon the
creole slave example made an instant impression,
whilst the newly imported African, slow to observe,
was only led into excesses by the craft and persuasion
of his creole fellow bondsman. Example, therefore,
most unquestionably suggested the extraordinary
cruelties which in the spirit of revenge were inflicted
by these infuriated people, instigated by the
mulattoes in the first instance for the more certain
enforcing of their claims to the privileges which
the decree of the 15th of May, 1791, conferred upon
them. In all these disputes the females of the colony
also bore a conspicuous part; entering into all
the views and feelings of their male companions,
they displayed an unparalleled degree of enthusiasm
for the cause in which their husbands, fathers and
brothers had respectively engaged: forgetting their
sex, and lost to the softer feelings of female nature,
they furiously flew to the standards of their party, and
by gesture and menace shewed that they were ready
to meet the fate which seemed likely to fall on their
friends.</p>

<p>I cannot better illustrate the characters of the
planters and the slave population at this period,
than by the description given of them by Rainsford
in his History of St. Domingo, who must have been
conversant with them from having been a sojourner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
in the colony under circumstances of great danger,
and whose experience, arising from general intercourse,
must enable him to be a very competent
judge. He says of them: “Flushed with opulence
and dissipation, the majority of the planters in St.
Domingo had arrived at a state of sentiment the
most vitiated, and manners equally depraved; while
injured by an example so contagious, the slaves had
become more dissolute than those of any British
island. If the master was proud, voluptuous, and
crafty, the slave was equally vicious, and often riotous;
the punishment of one was but the consequent
of his own excesses, but that of the other was often
cruel and unnatural. The proprietor would bear
no rival in his parish, and would not bend even to
the ordinances of justice. The creole slaves looked
upon the newly imported Africans with scorn, and
sustained in turn that of the mulattoes, whose complexion
was browner, while all were kept at a distance
from an intercourse with the whites; nor did
the boundaries of sex, it is painful to observe, keep
their wonted distinction from the stern impulses
which affect men. The European ladies too often
participated in the austerity and arrogance of their
male kindred, while the jet black beauty among
slaves, though scarcely a native of the island, refused
all commerce with those who could not boast
the same distinction with herself.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class="pch">First revolt of the slaves in 1791.&mdash;Their ravages.&mdash;Decree
of the national assembly 4th of April 1792.&mdash;Santhonax
and Polverel.&mdash;Their secret agency.&mdash;Encourage
the slaves.&mdash;Their declaration of freedom to
the slaves.&mdash;Consequences arising from it.&mdash;Character

<p class="pn2"><span class="smcap">In</span> the preceding chapter I have sought to discover
if the first cause of the revolt of the slaves in Hayti
proceeded from any hatred towards their proprietors,
or if it were excited by the intrigues of the contending
parties, who were each attempting to gain over
that class in favour of their cause; and I find that
the result of my investigation of the subject is in
favour of the latter supposition. From facts that
appear to me undeniable I have come to the conclusion,
that unless the national assembly of France
had made an attempt to destroy that principle of
governing the colony which had previously been
adopted, and which before the Revolution had been
sanctioned by every person connected with it, the
slave population would have remained until this day
peaceable and tranquil observers of passing events,
unmindful of their being in bondage, because under
that bondage they had no wants, and in that state,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
whatever may be the opinion of mankind, they had
no care beyond that of their daily labour, to which
they felt it was no hardship to submit; for there
does not appear an instance in which it exceeded the
ordinary work of any labourer within the tropics.</p>

<p>The revolt of the slaves, therefore, I take leave
to say, did not proceed from any severity or great
oppression on the part of their proprietors, but from
the proceedings of the parties who at different periods
were striving for a preponderating power in
the colony:&mdash;of the whites who aimed at the preservation
of their privileges, and resisted all innovation;
and of the people of colour, who made
every possible effort to be admitted into the same
sphere, and to the enjoyment of those rights which
Gregoire and his revolutionary colleagues were
willing to concede to them. To these causes, and
to these alone, as it will appear to every unbiassed
reader, are to be attributed all those lamentable
scenes which subsequently ensued, and to which the
human mind cannot turn its attention without experiencing
those painful sensations which are excited
by the ravages of civil warfare and rebellion.</p>

<p>The first act of open rebellion among the slaves
appears to have occurred in the vicinity of the Cape
on or about the 23d of August 1791, on the plantation
Noé, situated in the parish of Acul. The
principal ringleaders murdered the white inhabitants,
whilst the other slaves finished the work of devastation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
by demolishing the works and setting fire
to the dwellings, huts, and other places contiguous
to them.</p>

<p>They were joined by the negroes from other
estates in the neighbourhood, upon all of which
similar tragedies were performed, and desolation
seemed likely to spread through the whole plains of
the north. The barbarity which marked their
progress exceeded description; an indiscriminate
slaughter of the whites ensued, except in instances
where some of the females were reserved for a more
wretched doom, being made to submit to the brutal
lusts of the most sanguinary wretches that ever disgraced
humanity. Cases are upon record, where the
most amiable of the female sex were first brought
forth to see their parents inhumanly butchered, and
were afterwards compelled to submit to the embraces
of the very villain who acted as their executioner.
The distinction of age had no effect on
these ruthless savages, for even girls of twelve and
fourteen years were made the objects of satiating
their lust and revenge. Nothing could exceed
the consternation of the white people; and the lamentations
of the unhappy women struck every one
with horror. Such a scene of massacre has scarcely
been heard of, as that which accompanied the commencement
of the rebellion in the north.</p>

<p>Some opposition was made to their progress by a
few militia and troops of the line, which M. De<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
Tonzard collected for the purpose; not indeed, with
the expectation of effectually dispersing them, but
of enabling the inhabitants of the city of Cape
François to put themselves in such a state of defence
as might save them from that destruction
which seemed to await them. The citizens flew to
arms, and the national guards, with the seamen from
the ships, were mustered, and ready to receive the
rebels should they make an attempt upon the city.</p>

<p>There was in the city at the time, a large body
of free mulattoes, on whom the lower order of whites
looked with a suspicious eye, as being in some way
the authors or fomenters of the revolt; these were
also enrolled in the militia, the governor and the
colonial assembly confiding in them, and relying on
their fidelity. The report of the revolt was soon
known throughout the whole colony, but more particularly
in the northern districts, the white inhabitants
of which, being speedily collected together, established
two strong posts at Grand Rivière and at
Dondon, for the purpose of checking the advance of
the revolters, until such time as a force could be
concentrated, sufficiently powerful to disperse them:
but in this they were disappointed, for the negroes
had increased their own numbers by the revolt of
the slaves on many other estates, and they had also
been joined by a large body of mulattoes. With
this united force, they successfully attacked the two
positions which were occupied by the whites, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
were completely routed. Success put the rebels in
possession of the extensive plain with all its surrounding
mountains, abounding with every production
of which they stood in need for their sustenance.</p>

<p>The defeat of the whites was followed by a scene of
cruelties and butcheries which exceeds imagination;
almost every individual who fell into the hands of the
revolters met with a wretched end, tortures of the
most shocking description being resorted to by these
blood-thirsty savages: blacks and mulattoes seemed
eager to rival each other in the extent of their enormities.</p>

<p>The union of the mulattoes with the revolted
slaves, was not an event unlocked for; as I have before
remarked, they were strongly suspected of being
the instigators of the rebellion. This junction caused
serious apprehensions, that those mulattoes who had
joined the whites in the city, and had marched for
the purpose of cooperating with the inhabitants of
the plains, would desert their posts and go over to
the revolters; and it is probable that such an event
might have ensued, had not the governor, before he
permitted them to be enrolled, and before he could
implicitly confide in them, demanded from them
their wives and children, as hostages for their adherence
to the cause which they had engaged to
support.</p>

<p>In this northern insurrection, the destruction of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
the white inhabitants, it is said, was considerable,
exceeding, of all ages, two thousand; besides the
demolition of the buildings of a great many plantations,
and the total ruin of many families, who
from a condition of ease and affluence were reduced
to the lowest state of misery and despair, being
driven to the melancholy necessity of supplicating
charity, to relieve the heart-rending calls of their
hungry and naked offspring. The loss of the insurgents
was however infinitely greater; being ignorant
of the effects of cannon they were consequently
cut down in masses, while the sword was also effectually
used. It appears that upwards of 10,000
of these sanguinary wretches fell in the field, besides
a very large number who perished by famine, and
by the hands of the executioner; a very just retribution
for their savage and inhuman proceedings.
There is every reason to believe that the loss sustained
by them in all their engagements must have
been immense, as they seemed to have imbibed a
most extraordinary idea of the effect of artillery:
it is said of them by a writer of repute, that “The
blacks suffered greatly in the beginning of the revolution
by their ignorance of the dreadful effects
of the guns, and by a superstitious belief, very generally
prevailing at that time, that by a few mysterious
words, they could prevent the cannon doing
them any harm, which belief induced them to face
the most imminent dangers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>Whilst these ravages were going on in the north,
the western district was menaced by a body of men
of colour, who had collected at Mirebalais, sanguinely
expecting to be joined by a large party of
slaves from the surrounding parishes. Their aim
was the possession of Port au Prince and the whole
plain of Cul de Sac; but being joined by only about
six or seven hundred of the slaves of the neighbourhood,
they did not succeed in their object; and
after having set fire to the coffee plantations in the
mountains, and done some injury amongst the estates
in the valley, they began to deliberate on their
condition, and to devise some plan, by which they
might be able to rescue themselves from the dilemma
into which they were thrown by their own rash and
improvident proceedings. Some of the most powerful
of the mulattoes, who found it impossible to gain
the negroes over to their cause, deemed it advisable
to propose an adjustment of their disputes, and attempt
to bring about a reconciliation with the whites.
One of the planters, a man of some power and
address, and having been always very highly esteemed
by the people of colour, as well as the negroes
through the whole of the Cul de Sac, interposed,
and a treaty was concluded on the 11th of September,
between the people of colour on the one part,
and the white inhabitants of Port au Prince on the
other.</p>

<p>This treaty was called the <i>Concordat</i>: it had for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
its basis the oblivion of past differences and the full
recognition of the decree of the national assembly of
the 15th of May. The treaty was subsequently
ratified by the general assembly of the colony, and
a proclamation was issued, in which it was held out
that further concessions were contemplated for the
purpose of cementing a good understanding between
both classes, and these concessions, it was supposed,
alluded to the admission of those persons of colour
to the privileges of the whole who were born of enslaved
parents. Mulattoes also were voted to be
eligible to hold commissions in the companies formed
of persons of their own colour, and some other
privileges of minor consideration conceded to them.
This, it was hoped, would restore order, and enable
the people once more to enjoy peace and repose.
But a circumstance occurred which blasted these
hopes, and the flame, which appears only to have
been partially subdued, was rekindled, and burst
forth again with an astonishing rapidity, devouring
all within its overwhelming reach.</p>

<p>Immediately after the ratification of the <i>Concordat</i>
by the colonial assembly had been announced, and
when it was admitted by all parties that its several provisions,
amongst them the decree of the 15th of May,
were judicious and highly commendable, tending to
preserve order and tranquillity through the island, intelligence
was received of the repeal of that very decree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
by the national assembly in France, and of its
having been voted by a very large majority. This
was followed too by an intimation that the national
assembly had determined on sending out
commissioners to enforce the decree of the 24th of
September 1791, which annulled the decree of the
15th of May, and to endeavour to restore order and
subordination. Such unaccountable, and, as they
may be justly characterized, deceptive proceedings
on the part of the national assembly excited the indignation
of the people of colour, who immediately
accused the whites of being privy to these transactions,
and declared that all further amity and good
understanding must be broken off, and that either
one party or the other must be annihilated. All
the coloured people in the western and southern
parts flew eagerly to the standard of revolt, and
having collected a strong force, they appeared in a
few days before Port au Prince, on which they made
an attempt, but as that city had been strengthened
by an additional force from France, it was enabled
to receive the attack of the insurgents, and ultimately
to repel them with no inconsiderable loss.
The city however sustained considerable injury, and
the revolters were successful in several attempts to
set fire to it, by which a very large part of it was
burnt down, or otherwise injured.</p>

<p>In the plains of the Cul de Sac the negroes joined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
the mulattoes, allured by the charm of plunder and
the pledge of freedom, and the expectation of satiating
their lust on the defenceless and unoffending
white females who should fall into their hands.
In these plains some sanguinary battles were fought,
remarkable however for nothing except the unrelenting
cruelties with which the prisoners of the respective
combatants were visited, and the barbarous
and inhuman executions which followed them.</p>

<p>In these engagements it is recorded that the
whites had the advantage, but they were unable to
follow up their success, being destitute of a force of
cavalry for the pursuit, a circumstance which made
it quite impossible for them to improve on any decisive
movement which they had effected. It appears,
that in every skirmish or engagement the whites
were in all cases most forward and bold in their attacks,
and few only were the instances in which the
contest was commenced by the mulattoes; whenever
they were brought in contact with their opponents
they exhibited no individual or collective displays
of courage and heroism, but, on the contrary, there
seemed a tincture of cowardice in all their proceedings,
for they arranged the negroes in front of their
position, and in all cases of advance these deluded
creatures bore the first attack of their adversaries,
whilst their coloured allies, leaders, and deluders,
often remained inactive during the moment of trial
and slaughter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>In December the commissioners Mirbeck, Roosne,
and St. Leger arrived. Their reception was respectful,
and there was a peculiar degree of submission
shewn to them; but when they proclaimed a general
amnesty and pardon to all who should submit
and desist from further acts of insubordination, and
subscribe the articles of the new constitution, a
general murmur was excited, and marks of disapprobation
were shewn towards them, not only by the
colonial assembly, but by every individual of the
contending parties. They remained in the island
but a short time; and as an opinion prevailed that
they were the mere instruments or organ of the
national assembly, they obtained no attention or respect.
Without any display of talent, they aspired
to the government of a people, who were not to be
commanded without being first taught that their
commission was of a pacific tendency, and that their
instructions were to appease, and not to excite. Instead
of this, they declined to give any explanation
of the object of their appointment beyond that
which had been previously known, the enforcing of
the decree of the 24th of September 1791. Finding
all their efforts unavailing, and that they were
unsupported by either party, finding that their authority
was disputed and their representations despised,
and, above all, left without any troops by
which they might attempt to enforce obedience to
their power, and submission to the decrees of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
mother-country, they took their departure from the
island by separate conveyances, after having made
many most ineffectual attempts to obtain the confidence
and the good opinion of the people over whom
they were sent to preside, and from whom they were
sent to exact an accordance with such measures as the
national assembly might think it expedient to adopt.</p>

<p>About this time, also, there were some changes
in France which indicated further arrangements
with respect to the administration of the colonies,
which could only tend to widen the breach, and inflame
the parties to that degree of violence which
would preclude the expectation of any amicable adjustment
at a future period. The society of Amis
des Noirs had now gained a considerable influence
in the national assembly, and there seemed to exist
an union of feeling in favour of the mulattoes, and
also of the slave population, whom it was designed
at no distant period to emancipate, however unprepared
they might be, by moral improvement, to receive
such a boon. It was suggested that instructions
should be sent out to the colonial assemblies,
conveying to them such intentions, as well as their
opinion of the means by which “slavery might be
abolished in toto”, without in the least affecting the
interest of the people, or in any way putting their
property in jeopardy. This design, however, of
the anti-slavery party in France met with some momentary
opposition, although the advocates of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
measure uttered loud invectives against the planters
in general; but whatever influence the former might
have collected and brought against the latter, it is
very clear it failed in its desired aim, for in less
than two months this assembly passed another decree,
which abrogated that of the 24th of September.
This decree is of the 4th of April 1792, and
it is the first step towards an emancipation of slavery,
although it does not declare such an intention.
It is important, and I shall therefore insert it from
a translation in another work, to the writer of which
I am much indebted.</p>

<p>“The national assembly acknowledges and declares,
that the people of colour and free negroes in
the colonies ought to enjoy an equality of political
rights with the whites; in consequence of which it
decrees as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Article 1st. Immediately after the publication
of the present decree, the inhabitants of each of
the French colonies in the windward and leeward
islands shall proceed to the re-election of colonial
and parochial assemblies, after the mode prescribed
by the decree of the 8th of March 1790, and the instructions
of the national assembly of the 28th of
the same month.</p>

<p>“2d. The people of colour and free negroes
shall be admitted to vote in all the primary and
electoral assemblies, and shall be eligible to the legislature
and all places of trust, provided they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
possess the qualifications prescribed by the fourth
article of the aforesaid instructions.</p>

<p>“3d. Three civil commissioners shall be named
for the colony of St. Domingo, and four for the
islands of Martinique, Guadaloupe, St. Lucia, and
Tobago, to see this decree enforced.</p>

<p>“4th. The said commissioners shall be authorized
to dissolve the present colonial assemblies; to
take every measure necessary for accelerating the
convocation of the primary and electoral assemblies,
and therein to establish union, order, and peace, as
well as to determine provisionally (reserving the
power of appeal to the national assembly) upon
every question which may arise concerning the regularity
of convocations, the holding of assemblies,
the form of elections, and the eligibility of citizens.</p>

<p>“5th. They are authorized to procure every information
possible, in order to discover the authors
of the troubles in St. Domingo, and the continuance
thereof, if they still continue; to secure the
persons of the guilty, and to send them over to
France, there to be put in a state of accusation, &amp;c.</p>

<p>“6th. The said civil commissioners shall be directed,
for this purpose, to transmit to the national
assembly minutes of their proceedings, and of the
evidence they may have collected concerning the
persons accused as aforesaid.</p>

<p>“7th. The national assembly authorizes the civil
commissioners to call forth the public force whenever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
they may think it necessary, either for their
own protection, or for the execution of such orders
as they may issue by virtue of the preceding articles.</p>

<p>“8th. The executive power is directed to send a
sufficient force to the colonies, to be composed
chiefly of national guards.</p>

<p>“9th. The colonial assemblies immediately after
their formation shall signify, in the name of each
colony respectively, their sentiments respecting that
constitution, those laws, and the administration of
them, which will best promote the prosperity and
happiness of the people, conforming themselves nevertheless
to those general principles by which the
colonies and the mother-country are connected together,
and by which their respective interests are
best secured, agreeably to the decree of the 8th of
March 1790 and instructions of the 28th of the
same month.</p>

<p>“10th. The colonial assemblies are authorized
to send home delegates for the purposes mentioned
in the preceding article, in numbers proportionate
to the population of each colony, which proportion
shall be forthwith determined by the national assembly,
according to the report which its colonial
committee is directed to make.</p>

<p>“11th. Former decrees respecting the colonies
shall be in force in every thing not contrary to the
present decree.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>The carrying of this decree into effect was entrusted
to Messrs. Santhonax, Polverel, and Ailhaud,
the executive in France sending out a body
comprising eight thousand men of the national
guards, for the purpose of compelling the colonists
to submit to their authority. Having arrived on
the 13th of September, their first act was to dissolve
the colonial assembly, and their next, to send the
governor, Blanchelande, to France, where, after an
examination into his administration, he was sentenced
to death, and suffered on the guillotine in
the April following. M. Desparbes, who was invested
with chief command in his stead, having
disagreed with the commissioners, was also suspended,
and, like his predecessor, he was sent to France
to undergo a similar fate.</p>

<p>The greatest consternation everywhere prevailed
on the announcement of this decree, and, as I have
before observed, a pretty general feeling existed,
that this was only a prelude to a general emancipation
of the slave population, and which afterwards
was actually realised. The white inhabitants, in
particular, suspected the candour of the commissioners,
who were anxious to have it believed that
the object of their mission was nothing more than
to carry into operation the provisions of this decree,
and to settle all those disputes between the one class
and the other, which had been fomented to the great
destruction of persons and property. These agents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
of the national assembly seem to have been well
skilled in the art of dissimulation, more particularly
the leader, M. Santhonax, who, whilst professing to
the whites the warmest solicitude and anxiety for
the preservation of peace and the promotion of the
prosperity of the colony, was secretly intriguing
with the mulattoes, and holding clandestine meetings
with their chiefs; and in the end, in conjunction
with his coadjutors, he openly declared that
they, with the free negroes, should enjoy their privileges,
receive the protection of the national guards,
and that he would espouse their cause in every possible
way in which it could be effectually promoted.</p>

<p>The properties of the white inhabitants, as well
as their lives, seemed at this juncture in the greatest
jeopardy, and they possessed no means of averting
the fate which seemed to await them. Some
little hope, however, was raised in their minds by
the appointment of a new governor, M. Galbaud,
who arrived to take the command in May 1793,
and to place the island in the strongest state of defence,
it being apprehended by the French government
that the British might interpose in the existing
disputes, as war had been declared between the
two powers. His arrival was hailed by the authorities
and the inhabitants of the Cape with the
strongest manifestations of joy, and from his having
property in the island, they had the highest confidence
in his character for probity, and anticipated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
that the most decisive measures would be adopted
for the restoration of their property, and for the
security of their lives. But how vain were their
anticipations, and how fleeting their hope! The
national assembly of France, the great mover of all
the evils which afflicted this unhappy country, again
interposed with new instructions, and suspended the
new governor from his command, decreeing that any
one holding property in the colonies should be ineligible
to fill any office of trust in the colony in
which his estate was situate.</p>

<p>Galbaud did not, however, resign his appointment
without a struggle; and aided by his brother,
a man of some spirit and great enterprise, he collected
a force composed of militia, seamen from the
ships in the harbour of the Cape, and a strong body
of volunteers, and without delay advanced against
the commissioners, whom he found ready to receive
him at the head of the regular troops. A conflict
severe and bloody ensued, and considerable resolution
was displayed by the rival parties, each supporting
their cause with unshaken firmness and determined
bravery; but the sailors, who composed
the greatest body of Galbaud’s force, having become
disorderly, he was obliged to retire, which he did
without being in the least interrupted or opposed
by the force of the commissioners.</p>

<p>The next day various skirmishes took place, in
which the success was in some degree mutual; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
whilst the brother of Galbaud fell into the hands of
the commissioners’ troops, the son of Polverel was
captured by the seamen attached to Galbaud’s force.
The commissioners finding, however, that their force
diminished, and that their opponents were resolute
and fought with unexampled bravery, had recourse
to a measure which in the sequel caused much
slaughter, although it succeeded in the destruction
of Galbaud’s force; they called in the aid of the
revolted slaves, offering them their freedom, and
promising that the city of the Cape should be given
up for plunder. Some of the rebel chiefs rejected a
proposition which could only produce the sacrifice
of lives and the spilling of human blood, without
in any way promoting their own cause, but Macaya,
a negro possessing some power over his adherents,
and being of a savage and brutal disposition, with
an insatiable thirst for the blood of the whites, accepted
the proposal of the commissioners, and with
three or four thousand of his negro brethren joined
their standard, when a scene of horror and of carnage
ensued, the recital of which would shock the
hardest and most unfeeling heart. Men, women,
and children were without distinction unmercifully
slaughtered by these barbarians, and those who had
escaped the first rush into the city, and had reached
the water-side, for the purpose of getting on board
the ships in the harbour, were intercepted and their
retreat cut off by these merciless wretches, just at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
the moment when arrangements had been accomplished
for their embarkation. Here the mulattoes
had an opportunity of gratifying their revenge;
here they had arrived at the summit of their greatest
ambition and glory; here it was that these
cowardly and infamous parricides, gorged with human
blood, sacrificed their own parents, and afterwards
subjected their bodies to every species of insult
and indignity; here it was that these disciples
of Robespierre&mdash;this injured and oppressed race&mdash;the
theme of Gregoire’s praise, and the subject of
his appeal and harangue, shewed themselves worthy
disciples of such masters! If any thing were
wanted to establish the fact of these scenes being
unexampled, and without a parallel, one thing, I am
sure, will alone be sufficient, and that is, that the
commissioners, these amiable representatives of the
national assembly, the <i>immaculate</i> Santhonax, and
the equally <i>humane</i> and <i>virtuous</i> Polverel, these
vicegerents of the society of Amis des Noirs, these
protectors of the mulattoes, were struck with horror
at the scene which was presented to them, and repaired
to the ships, there to become spectators of
the effects of their own crimes, and of a splendid
and opulent city devoured by the flames which had
been lighted by the torch of anarchy and rebellion.</p>

<p>In this destruction of the Cape, some instances
of the most extraordinary brutality were exhibited,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
and others of devotedness and heroism were displayed;
one or two it will be as well to mention, as
illustrative of the generosity and humanity of the
one party, and of the ferocity and cruelty of the
other. When the revolters first entered the city,
every man, woman, and child were bayoneted or cut
down with such instruments as they could muster,
but the young females were in most cases spared,
for the momentary gratification of the lust of those
into whose hands they fell. One case of the most
singular enormity took place:&mdash;a leader of the revolted
slaves, named Gautier, had entered the
house of a respectable merchant in the square, in
which were the proprietor, his wife, his two sons,
and three daughters; the sons were young, not exceeding
the age of ten, but the daughters were elegant
young women, the eldest about eighteen, and the
youngest not exceeding fourteen. Gautier, assisted
by one or two wretches equally inhuman, promised
to spare the family, on account of his having
received many acts of kindness and generosity
from the father, to whom he was often sent by
his master on business, he being a domestic slave.
These poor creatures, who were at first half-expiring
from the terror of the scene around them,
and from the idea of being the captives of barbarians,
recovered somewhat from the alarm into
which they had been thrown, through the promises
of security thus unconditionally pledged to them;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
and although not permitted to go out of the sight of
their captors, they did not apprehend that any mischief
was in embryo, and that their lives were to be
sacrificed. Impressed with the idea of safety, they
proceeded to prepare a repast for their supposed
guardians, and set it before them in the same splendour
as they were wont to do when receiving their
best and dearest friends. Gautier drank freely, and
his compeers did no little justice to the rich repast.
Night coming on, and apprehensive of the consequences
of a surprise from the governor’s force,
they began to deliberate upon what plan they should
adopt to secure their unhappy captives from flight,
when, not being able to devise any thing likely to
be effectual, they came to the savage resolution of
murdering them all. The daughters were locked
up in a room, under the watch of two of the revolters,
whilst the remainder of them commenced
the bloody task by bayoneting the two sons. The
mother, on her knees, imploring mercy with pitiful
cries, met with the same fate, whilst the husband,
who was bound hand and foot, was barbarously
mangled, by having first his arms and then
his legs cut off, and afterwards run through the
body. During this blood-thirsty scene, the daughters,
ignorant of the tragic end of their parents,
were in a state of alarm and terror not to be described,
yet hoping that their lives were safe. But,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
alas! how deceitful that hope! for their destiny
was fixed, and their time but short. Gautier and
his diabolical associates went into their room,
stripped them naked, and committed on their defenceless
persons the most brutal enormities, when
with the dead bodies of their parents they were
thrown into the flames which were then surrounding
them, where they all perished.</p>

<p>I shall mention another case of an opposite character,
and in which a degree of heroism was exhibited
that deserves to be recorded with every praise.
A M. Tardiffe, a planter, and a young man of considerable
property and of great courage and presence
of mind, had joined the force of the governor,
and had consequently become an object of great
hatred, particularly on the part of some of the
mulattoes who resided in the vicinity of his estate.
Awakened one night about twelve o’clock by the
cries of females, he jumped up, and rushed to the
room in which his sisters, two amiable young ladies,
were reposing, where he found armed men attempting
to get through the window. He instantly flew
for his sabre and pistols, which were loaded, his
sisters following him, and then returned to the room
to oppose the assassins. He found one had accomplished
his purpose of getting into the room, whom
he in an instant ran through the body; when, turning
to the window, he shot another fellow just entering,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
and afterwards one or two others who made
similar attempts. About this time his domestics had
all come up stairs, and they shewed themselves most
faithful in adhering to their master; for, not contented
with merely opposing the entry of the assassins
into the house, they sallied forth to meet them at
the front of it, and although their numbers were
inferior to that of their unprincipled and lawless
invaders, they successfully attacked them, killing
seven, and driving away the rest, with the exception
of one, who was captured, who happened to be
the illegitimate brother of M. Tardiffe, to whom
he had shewed the warmest affection and whom he
had cherished as the dearest relation. In return
for such ingratitude and villainy, how did M. Tardiffe
act? Did he give him up for public justice?
No. Did he permit his faithful and enraged domestics,
who were witnesses of his crimes, to execute
momentary vengeance upon him? No. But
he took him by the hand, mildly remonstrated with
him, and afterwards furnished him with the means
of leaving the colony for America, lest the searching
hand of justice might before long stay his career.
I have thought it adviseable to relate these
two cases, from the extraordinary enormity of the
first, and from the singular circumstances attending
the last, having received the detail of them from
an individual who was engaged in most of the
events which occurred at that period.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>After this first revolt of the slaves in the north,
emigrations commenced in almost all parts of the
colony, some going to the United States, many to
the neighbouring islands; and some of the most
opulent and powerful of the planters to England,
under the impression that the British government
would be disposed to turn its attention to their cause.
The war between France and England having commenced,
some regard was paid to their solicitations,
and through the instance of M. Charmilly (the M.
Charmilly of Spanish notoriety) the government of
England sent out directions to the governor of Jamaica
to afford to those inhabitants of St. Domingo
who were desirous to place themselves under British
protection every possible support, and to send
without delay a competent force, and to take possession
of such places as the people might be disposed
to surrender to them.</p>

<p>The intentions of the British government being
known by the means of secret agents, the commissioners,
Santhonax and Polverel, had recourse to
every possible means of strengthening the force in
the colony, and of being prepared for the reception
of the British troops whenever they should make
their contemplated descent. They collected the regular
troops, militia, and such of the whites as were
in their interest, together with the free negroes and
mulattoes who had hitherto followed their cause.
But this was not deemed by them a sufficient body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
when united, to oppose British soldiers led on by
experienced commanders. They therefore at once
“proclaimed the abolition of every species of slavery,
declaring that the negroes were thenceforth to be
considered as free citizens”; and thereby assigned
over to a lawless banditti the fee simple of every
property in the French part of the island of St.
Domingo, placing every white inhabitant within
almost the grasp of a set of people insensible to
every feeling of humanity, rude and ruthless as in
their native wilds.</p>

<p>A description of these untutored people cannot be
better given than in the language of Mr. Edwards,
who says, “The Charaibs of St. Vincent, and the
Maroons of Jamaica, were originally enslaved Africans;
and what they now are, the freed negroes of
St. Domingo will be hereafter,&mdash;savages in the
midst of society, without peace, security, agriculture,
or property; ignorant of the duties of life, and
unacquainted with all the soft endearing relations
which rendered it desirable; averse to labour, though
frequently perishing for want; suspicious of each
other, and towards the rest of mankind revengeful
and faithless, remorseless and bloody-minded; pretending
to be free while groaning beneath the capricious
despotism of their chiefs, and feeling all the
miseries of servitude without the benefits of subordination.”
The prediction of this elegant author has
certainly been realized in all its parts, and subsequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
events have fully confirmed the opinion which he had
formed of the negro character, when left to his own
uncontrolled will and unrestrained in his propensities.
Sloth, lust, and every species of wantonness and
cruelty marked the progress of the enfranchised
slaves in the first moment of their freedom; and until
leaders of decisive and resolute powers for command
undertook to preserve some degree of order
and submission, they wandered in parties through
the different parishes, inflicting the most unheard-of
cruelties on the innocent and unoffending, without
regard to sex or colour. To the will and command
of their chief they were generally obedient, although
they were subjected to duties of the most
dangerous and laborious description; but when the
least relaxation of discipline was permitted, they
again resorted to plunder and destruction, and to
every other species of insubordination, gratifying
their insatiable thirst for the blood of the whites,
as well as of that of the mulattoes, who were averse
to the measure of emancipation. In these predatory
excursions they committed the most shocking excesses,
and more real and afflicting accounts have
been received of the enormities practised by them
when wandering in detached parties, than have been
known to follow the most sanguinary battle in which
they had been engaged.</p>

<p>I see nothing through the whole career of the rebellion
to induce me to alter my opinion of the cause<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
whence all these lamentable effects sprung; and
I must again repeat, that it was not misconduct on
the part of the proprietors which excited the first
revolt, and induced the slaves to take up arms
against those from whom, in innumerable instances,
they had experienced kindness and indulgence. It
was natural to expect that in a colony, the operations
in which are entirely performed by slaves,
some cases of oppression would occur which would
justly deserve reprobation; but the rebellion became
general, although I am not aware that any
successful attempt has been made to shew that the
conduct of the planters towards their slaves was generally
harsh and oppressive.</p>

<p>De Vastey, in his remarks, would wish it to be
inferred that the brute creation received infinitely
more kindness and indulgence from their master
than was shewn towards the slave: but De Vastey
being a negro, it is natural that he should exhibit
the worst side of the picture, without noticing its
better one. He adduces no instances of that oppression
which he wishes to prevail upon mankind
to believe to have been inflicted: we have nothing
from him but allegations and assertions, without
proof to support them. It is true, that he puts forward
some statements of cruelties inflicted on his negro
brethren, but those were subsequent, even by his
own account, to the revolt and to the emancipation;
but he has forgotten that the first atrocities, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
first acts of cruelty and indiscriminate murder, were
committed by his very brethren (for whom he claims
the pity of mankind for their sufferings and for
their unmerited bondage) on the plantation Noé,
and others in the vicinity. De Vastey, it is plain,
is no authority on which the charge of cruelty on
the part of the planter <i>before</i> the rebellion can be
supported.</p>

<p>With regard to the mulattoes, or free men of colour,
who were doubtless the chief instigators of
the rebellion and of the first revolt of the slaves,
although they cannot escape the condemnation justly
due to them for their perfidy, yet the extreme
disabilities under which they laboured in some
measure might be adduced in mitigation of the censure
which their faithless conduct so truly deserved.
If they had not commenced the work of
revolt, but had remained quiet observers of the
proceedings of the national and colonial assemblies,
and delayed their operations until the result
of the deliberations and arrangements of those
bodies had been promulgated, they would have
called forth spontaneous expressions of approbation
from all classes of people: but the eagerness which
they manifested for civil feuds and for a preponderancy
of power in the colony, without any conditions
and without the least possible reservation, has
called down upon them, and I think justly too, very
severe reprobation. It has been observed, that this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
class of people were, from their education and from
their general demeanour, as eligible members of society
as the whites, and as such ought to have been
admitted into all its rights and advantages. This,
I believe, no one undertakes to deny; but it is no
more than fair and equitable towards the white population
to observe, that prior to every concession
being made to them, something like a line of demarcation
should have been drawn as to the limits to
which those concessions should be carried, otherwise
from their number and power the mulattoes might
have obtained an overwhelming preponderancy in the
colony, rendering the white colonists mere cyphers.</p>

<p>The decrees against the people of colour, as they
appear on the records of the colony, are extremely
harsh and impolitic, and a relaxation, if not a repeal
of them, would have been only an act of justice.
The government held them in no repute, but
considered them as it were national property, and
gave the public a right in them. They were subjected
by the governors, when they had arrived at a
particular age, to a military servitude of the most degrading
kind, and for a time to labour on the public
roads, the severity of which was almost too great to
be borne. They were not permitted to hold any office
of power or trust in the state, nor could they
even follow the humble calling of a schoolmaster.
The least possible taint in the blood excluded them,
and the distinction of colour had no termination. Not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
so in the British colonies, where it is lost in the third
generation. It is said also, that “the courts of criminal
jurisdiction adopting the popular prejudices
against them gave effect and permanency to the
system. A man of colour, being a prosecutor, must
have made out a strong case indeed, if at any time
he obtained the conviction of a white person. On
the other hand, the whites never failed to procure
prompt and speedy justice against mulattoes. To
mark more strongly the distinction between the
two classes, the law declared that if a free man of
colour presumed to strike a white person, of whatever
condition, his right hand should be cut off;
while a white man for a similar assault on a free
mulatto was dismissed on the payment of an insignificant
fine.”<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>It is, I conceive, impossible for any one to be informed
of the existence of such a system without
exclaiming, that whatever might have been the proceedings
of the people of colour in the work of rebellion,
their grievances offered considerable extenuation
of their conduct. This presents the most
disgraceful and indefensible page in the colonial records
of criminal jurisprudence. True it is that
its severity, that its flagrant injustice, precluded
the possibility of putting it in force; the abhorrence
which it so generally excited among all orders of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
people, made it a dead letter; but it was notwithstanding
a law in force, and might have been acted
upon by an arbitrary and unmerciful judge.</p>

<p>The only circumstance that contributed towards
affording the coloured people some degree of security
and protection under their disabilities was
the power which they indirectly derived from the
possession of property in the colony. They consequently
had influence, because under a corrupt
government money bought it, and many were the
venal officers of the state who had stooped to be
their pensioners. Many of these mulattoes held
large estates, and possessed besides extensive available
funds; these men in most cases evaded those
exclusions from society, to which their brethren of
less influence were obliged to submit. They were
secure enough both in their persons and property,
whilst the less wealthy among their coloured brethren
had to submit to every species of insecurity
and mortification.</p>

<p>I have now said as much as may be deemed necessary
on the subject of the situation of the coloured
people at the time of the first disturbances
in St. Domingo, and I trust I have made it appear
conclusive, that the cause of those disturbances did
not proceed from the oppression and the tyranny
practised over the slaves, but from the measures of
the national assembly, the colonial assemblies, aided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
by that specious and intriguing body, the society of
Amis des Noirs, and the coloured people then residing
in France, who had been tainted with the
pernicious doctrines then prevailing in that country.</p>

by General Maitland.&mdash;M. Charmilly negotiates with
the English.&mdash;Views of the English cabinet.&mdash;Parties in

<p class="pn2"><span class="smcap">Having</span>, in the last chapter, arrived at the period
when Santhonax and Polverel conferred freedom
upon the slave population, and at the time also when
the planters of the colony had solicited the aid of
the British government to their cause, I shall now
proceed in my detail of the effects produced by the
former, and, in as succinct a manner as possible, notice
a few of the operations of the latter, as well as
the consequences arising from them.</p>

<p>No sooner had the abolition of slavery been promulgated,
than it spread through the whole colony
with remarkable rapidity, and the work of insubordination
and destruction commenced. In the different
parishes the slaves rose simultaneously, formed
into bodies, took possession of the mountains,
and secured themselves within those fastnesses which
everywhere abound through the island. They then
sallied forth into the plains, spreading devastation
around them, setting fire to the cane fields, and demolishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
every description of habitation within
their range, murdering the unoffending white inhabitants
wherever they met with them. In one part
of the colony the insurgents amounted to nearly one
hundred thousand, without any leader who had the
least possible command over them. In the north
their force in the first instance only amounted from
about twenty to twenty-five thousand, but they
quickly increased to forty thousand of a most desperate
and sanguinary character.</p>

<p>The British force under Colonel Whitelocke made
its appearance before Jeremie on the 19th of September
1793; it consisted only of about eight hundred
and seventy rank and file. As this place was
to be given up to the British force by stipulation,
the town was taken possession of the next day, and
the inhabitants all took the oath of allegiance with
much eagerness. Cape St. Nicolas next followed;
but here the inhabitants displayed some hostility,
and most of them joined the standard of republicanism,
although they had before strenuously adhered
to the royal cause, and kept the white flag always
hoisted. Tiburon was next tried, but here, notwithstanding
the strongest pledges of cooperation on
the part of the planters, their infidelity was so manifest,
and the force of the enemy had become so
formidable, that the troops were obliged to retreat
with some loss, and this object of the expedition
therefore unfortunately failed. From fatigue and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
from sickness, from the exposure to which they had
been subjected, both in the sun and the noxious
dews of night, the troops became much dispirited
and discouraged, and further operations were suspended
until a force from England arrived of
sufficient magnitude to prosecute further offensive
measures. This did not take place until the
February following, when a British squadron arrived
with troops, which were immediately landed,
with Major (now Sir Brent) Spencer at their head,
who most gallantly attacked the enemy, drove them
back with considerable loss, and thereby retrieved
that which before ended in a failure. The whole
bight of Leogane was now commanded by the British
squadron, and a further force being expected from
England, it was anticipated that Port au Prince
would fall an easy conquest, from the supposition
that the people were mostly in favour of their cause.
A considerable time elapsed before the reinforcements
from England made their appearance; in the
interim, many skirmishes took place in the vicinity
of Leogane, as well as at Tiburon, and in the neighbourhood
of Cape Nicolas Mole; in some instances
the British were successful, and in others the enemy
obtained advantages.</p>

<p>About this period it was that Andrew Rigaud
first made his appearance at the head of the revolted
slaves: he was a man of colour, and had the command
at Aux Cayes. With about two thousand of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
the rebels he marched from his station and besieged
Tiburon; but the fort which was manned by some
British soldiers, who defended it with their usual
intrepidity, and who afterwards sallied forth, attacked
the besiegers in the field, and put them to the rout
with great slaughter.</p>

<p>During the interval occasioned by the non-arrival
of the reinforcement from England, the planters
who were, in the first instance, favourable to the
cause of the British, began to shew some symptoms
of displeasure; and the tardiness with which the
operations were carried on, and the absence of that
decision which the urgency of their situation required,
induced many very powerful individuals to
relinquish all further adherence to the party in
which they had engaged, and to join the republican
standard.</p>

<p>On the 19th of May the force which had been so
long looked for arrived under the command of General
Whyte, who, with Commodore Ford, proceeded
at once to deliberate on the measures which it would
be adviseable to adopt for the capture of Port au
Prince. On the 30th the ships of war, consisting
of four ships of the line, three or four frigates, and
several smaller vessels, anchored off the city. The
land forces amounted to only about fifteen hundred
men capable of doing duty. The next morning a
flag was sent to summon the city to surrender, to
which no attention was paid, and it is even said that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
the letter was returned unopened. The commissioners,
Santhonax and Polverel, were known to be
in the city with a considerable force; and it was
expected that a powerful stand would be made, for
the preservation of this important place. Fort Bizotton,
which is situate on an eminence to the southward
of the city, commands the Leogane road and
the southern entrance in the harbour. The land-side
was attacked by a body of troops under the gallant
Major Spencer, whilst a simultaneous attack was
made on the sea-side by two of the ships of war.
Captain Daniel of the forty-first regiment, with
about seventy or eighty men, took advantage of
a thunder storm which happened about eight
o’clock, entered the breach which had been rendered
practicable, and carried the fort at the point of
the bayonet. The captain was severely wounded,
and some of his men and officers fell. The city
soon surrendered, and the commissioners evacuated
it on the fourth of June, the birth-day of the then
sovereign of Great Britain, George the Third, when
the British troops entered and took possession of it
together with the shipping in the harbour. It was
the intention of the republican commissioners to set
fire to the city, but the prompt and decisive attack
of the British gave them no time for carrying so destructive
a design into effect.</p>

<p>This capture was of great consequence to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
cause of the British as far as their proceedings
had gone on; it gave confidence to the soldiers,
and inspirited the colonial troops who had joined
their standard; but it afterwards proved to be the
grave of many a British officer and soldier: sickness
began to rage amongst the troops to such
an alarming extent, as is generally the case in the
autumnal months, that it was found necessary, for
the preservation of the post, to erect additional lines
of defence, fearing that in their then condition the
enemy might try to regain the position. To accomplish
this, the troops were subjected to incessant
toil, first in the sun, and then during the night exposed
to all the pernicious vapours arising from
heavy rains which fall during the rainy seasons. In
point of booty the capture of Port au Prince was a
very fine acquisition, although the commissioners
carried off with them every thing valuable which it
contained, consisting of upwards of two hundred
mule loads. They were accompanied also by upwards
of two thousand of the inhabitants, who followed
in their career. Finding however that they
had lost all their influence in the colony, and that
Rigaud and Toussaint L’Ouverture had obtained
possession of the whole, they thought it expedient
to leave the island, and return to France, where they
received the congratulations of the government, whose
representatives they had been appointed to carry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
into operation the most injudicious decrees that
could possibly have been framed for the internal government
of any colonial appendage.</p>

<p>The value of the captured property has been variously
estimated: a writer of some authority says,
that “In the harbour were found two and twenty
top-sail vessels, fully laden with sugar, indigo, and
coffee, of which thirteen were from three to five
hundred tons burthen, and the remaining nine from
one hundred and fifty to three hundred tons, besides
seven thousand tons of shipping in ballast; the
value of all which at a moderate computation could
not be far short of four hundred thousand pounds
sterling. One hundred and thirty-one pieces of cannon
regularly mounted in batteries were on the
lines.”</p>

<p>After the reduction of Port au Prince, a further
reinforcement arrived under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel
Lennox, consisting of about six hundred
men, but on their passage from the windward
islands to Jamaica, to which latter place they first
sailed, sickness broke out amongst them, by which
more than one hundred died on board, and a hundred
and fifty were left at Port Royal in the last
stage of disease. It is impossible to describe the
mortality that prevailed amongst the troops in St.
Domingo. When active operations were likely to
be attended with a beneficial result, the commander-in-chief
was prevented from taking advantage of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
positions which he held, by the epidemic which at
the time so lamentably raged. There could not be
produced eight hundred British soldiers in a condition
for the field, and many of them had only a
short time previously been discharged from the hospitals;
of course they were not equal to the fatigue
of active service, nor were they in the least fit for a
duty which rendered it necessary to expose them to
the pernicious humidity of the night air. The commander-in-chief,
General Whyte, was seized with
this malignant fever; and his health was so much
impaired by the effects of disease, and anxiety for
the fate of his officers and men, who were daily dying
around him, that he was compelled to leave the
island and return to England, when the command
devolved on Brigadier-General Horneck.</p>

<p>From the departure of General Whyte in September
1794, until the arrival of General Williamson
in the month of May following, nothing of any
material consequence ensued, except some skirmishes
between the posts of the British and revolters, attended
with no decisive result on either side. During
this short period of inactivity on the part of the
British, Rigaud, collecting a strong force, advanced
towards Leogane, which at that time was defended
by some colonial troops, and succeeding in his attack
upon the place, he inhumanly murdered the
French planters who fell into his power, and afterwards
advanced upon Port au Prince; but in his attempt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
upon Fort Bizotton which commanded his
advance, he failed, having been repulsed by the
garrison, with great slaughter, whence he retreated,
for the purpose of making another effort for the
recovery of Tiburon. He left Aux Cayes with a
force of three thousand men with four small armed
vessels, and on the 25th of December they commenced
the attack on the place. The fort, which
consisted of only about four hundred and fifty men,
defended it with great bravery; and after the loss of
two-thirds of their number, the remainder sallied
forth, cut their way through the revolters, and
reached Irois in safety.</p>

<p>In the vicinity of St. Marc, Colonel Brisbane, who
commanded there, had much to do in keeping the
insurgents in check, who had at this time become exceedingly
bold in their movements, and seemed determined
on the most vigorous operations, both offensive
and defensive. The colonel with a few British
and some colonial troops, obtained advantages over
them in several skirmishes in the plains of the Artibanite;
but whilst he was engaged there the mulatto
inhabitants of St. Marc, who had pledged themselves
most solemnly to observe the strictest neutrality,
violated their pledge, and in the most cowardly
manner put to death all whom they found actively
engaged against the French republic. The garrison
defended themselves in the fort, from whence they
were relieved in a short time by a vessel of war from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
Cape Nicolas Mole. The white inhabitants also of
St. Marc, many of whom were the most forward to
hail the arrival of the British and to place themselves
under British protection, engaged in a plot
for the destruction of Colonel Brisbane, but that officer,
ever on the alert, discovered and successfully
defeated their designs.</p>

<p>At Port au Prince a similar conspiracy was
brought to light, the object of which was the destruction
of the garrison and all the English people
by those very French inhabitants who joined in
hailing with acclamations the arrival of the British
force before the city. Such abominable treachery
did not go without its commensurate punishment;
the conspirators were seized, and about twenty of
the principal ones, amongst whom were several
French officers of rank, were condemned by the sentence
of a court-martial. Of these conspirators fifteen
were shot on the 18th of February, 1795, and
the remainder were sent off the island.</p>

<p>General Williamson, who had been previously
appointed commander-in-chief in the West Indies,
arrived in the island in May, and immediately proceeded
to place every station in the best state of defence
that his very limited means would allow. He
endeavoured to strengthen the whole line of posts
from St. Marc to Jeremie, and not having a force
sufficient to enable him to secure all points by a
strong cordon of British and colonial troops, he resorted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
to a measure which, although at the moment
it might have been one of expediency, was not likely
to be advantageous in the end. To augment his
force he formed several corps of negroes, whom he
purchased of the French planters, and placed them
under the command of officers of the line; but their
inefficiency was soon discovered, and they became
not only a very unserviceable, but also a very ungovernable
body. General Williamson retained the
command but a very short time; his successor,
General Forbes, completed the arrangements of his
predecessor, and remained entirely on the defensive.</p>

<p>In the autumn of this year, 1795, intelligence had
been received that the war between France and
Spain had terminated, and that the Spanish part of
the island had been ceded to the French republic in
perpetuity. It was stipulated, however, that so many
of the inhabitants as should feel disposed to depart
from the island to reside in the dominions of the
King of Spain, should be permitted to remove or
dispose of their property, and that the space of one
year should be granted to them for that purpose.</p>

<p>About the end of this year the termination of the
operations in Flanders having placed troops at the
disposal of the British government, Brigadier-General
Howe arrived with about seven thousand men
at Cape Nicolas Mole. From the extent of this
force a great deal might have been accomplished
had they arrived at an earlier stage of the proceedings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
in the island, but the subjugation of the colony had
now become extremely difficult, if not altogether impracticable.
They attempted but little, and becoming
languid and spiritless from sickness and disease,
whilst the enemy were increasing in numbers, as well
as in vigour and activity, the little that was undertaken
proved unsuccessful.</p>

<p>It was not until the month of March, 1797, that
any active operations were recommenced; when General
Simcoe landed to take the command, an officer
who had been selected by his government for the
important trust, from his known talents and tried experience.
He began his arduous undertaking by
examining the whole line of defence, and lost no
time in making every judicious arrangement for resuming
offensive operations. It was also about the
same time that the negro Toussaint L’Ouverture
appeared invested by the republican government
of France with the high rank of General-in-Chief
of the Armies of St. Domingo. To this very
extraordinary personage the British general was
destined first to be opposed; and from the system
of insurrectional warfare which had been pursued,
the general found he had to combat with an
antagonist of no ordinary capacity and courage.
Wary and exceedingly cautious, well acquainted with
the strength of the British force and the experience
of their commanders, Toussaint made no effort
beyond that of menacing the position of Mirebalais,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
before which he appeared with an almost overwhelming
force. The British force at that point
not being sufficient to oppose his progress, retired
thence through the plains of Cul de Sac into Port
au Prince, abandoning the whole of the country
through which they retreated, and from which,
from its fertility, the enemy were enabled to obtain
abundance of provisions. By this movement also
all communication with the Spanish part of the
island was cut off.</p>

<p>To the southward, however, the operations were
more favourable to the British. The negroes were
driven from every post which they had occupied in
the neighbourhood of Port au Prince, and Rigaud
at the head of his mulatto force was defeated at
Irois. Nearly at the same time Toussaint attacked
St. Marc’s, but was obliged to retire with considerable
loss, leaving a great many of his followers prisoners.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these partial successes the British
cause in the island seemed on the wane, and
their force diminishing from a variety of concurrent
circumstances, no attempt was afterwards made
to advance against the enemy; but measures were
adopted to guard against any surprise or any attack
which their opponents contemplated upon those
positions, in the line of defence, which were considered
to be vulnerable. In the interim, and during
the existence of this irregular warfare, General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
Simcoe, finding that in the present condition of
his forces nothing could be undertaken with the
least probability of success, and that to remain
within his line of defence was imperative, left
the island about the month of August, when the
command devolved on Major-General Whyte. Finally,
however, the Honourable Brigadier-General
Maitland succeeded, to whom was left the important
duty of making the most beneficial arrangements
for evacuating the island, which his situation could
command. And when it is considered that that gallant
officer (who did not arrive until April, 1798,)
took the command of the British forces under circumstances
of extreme difficulty and discomfiture,
at the moment of disasters and distress, the termination
of the contest, the subsequent truce and negotiations
with Toussaint, although making some
concession, were called for by considerations of
overwhelming expediency. These negotiations gave
up the whole of the British possessions, and their
colonial black troops (for whom a very large sum of
money was paid to the very persons who afterwards
took arms against them) to the black general, Toussaint,
in the name of the French republic, and thus
ended an enterprise from which no advantage resulted
either to the ex-colonists or to the interests
of Great Britain.</p>

<p>It is not my province to enter into a discussion
of the merits of the enterprise into which Great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
Britain had been led, nor shall I venture to censure
the undertaking on the one hand, or to applaud
it on the other. It was commenced unquestionably
at an unfavourable period, when the government
of England had to contend, not only
against the gigantic power of the French republic in
Europe, but against the revolutionary spirit which
had manifested itself at that time in England. Involved,
therefore, as she was at the time of the
emigration of the French agents from St. Domingo
in disputes abroad and in domestic feuds at home,
it is not surprising that those efforts were not made
which the planters had anticipated, and which they
were led to expect from the pledges which had been
given to M. Charmilly, who had been the organ of
those planters, and who, it is to be feared, was too
sanguine in his representations of the unanimity
which prevailed amongst them. I should be disposed
to think favourably of the conduct of M.
Charmilly had I not received the most unquestionable
information, that his communications were much
too highly coloured, and that his zeal for the cause
of his colony somewhat exceeded that which ought
to have been evinced by a discreet and prudent negotiator.
The British general was without doubt deceived
as to the strength of the revolters and as to
the disposition of the planters; and the unanimity
said to have existed amongst them, was most manifestly
negatived by subsequent events, in which intrigue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
and treachery superseded fidelity and honour.
M. Charmilly, however, in the opinions of many,
may not have subjected himself to censure by his
conduct; he may have been actuated by the best of
motives, and have thought, at the time, that by exhibiting
a favourable side of the picture the impression
would be likely to succeed; but the best informed
persons, with whom I have had opportunities
of conversing on the subject, have given it as their
unbiassed sentiment, that had not the disposition of
the colony been too favourably represented, the British
cabinet would either never have entered into
the contest, or have undertaken it with their accustomed
promptitude and known vigour; they would
never have left any thing to chance, nor have depended
so much upon extensive cooperation.</p>

<p>However much inclined Great Britain might have
been to seize a favourable moment for dismembering
republican France of her colonial possessions,
yet I think she would have paused before she commenced
any offensive operations against St. Domingo
in its then insurrectional state, had she not
been led by the most specious arguments to believe
that the object was attainable without any great efforts;
for although the slaves were in open rebellion,
still they, as well as the mulattoes, were divided
against themselves, and that an interposing
power would inevitably turn the scale, and eventually
succeed in restoring tranquillity, and finally the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
conquest of the whole colony. That the cabinet of
England had been influenced by the accounts laid
before it of the state of St. Domingo, needs no further
argument than this, that the force sent was
quite inadequate for the accomplishment of the object,
which certainly would not have happened, had
the descent upon that island received that deliberation
which was usually given to similar operations
in the time of war.</p>

<p>Before I proceed any further in my remarks, it
may not be irrelevant to shew who were the parties
engaged in this civil warfare and general havoc in
the colony, for I find only one or two who have
written before me who have been sufficiently clear
and explicit on this point; and it is probable that I
may not be quite so explanatory as the subject requires,
but I shall, I trust, succeed in dissipating
some of the cloud in which the whole seems to have
been enveloped.</p>

<p>At the commencement of the revolution in the
colony, the party that first appeared was composed
of those white inhabitants who were tainted with republicanism,
those of the mulattoes or gens de couleur
of property who imbibed the same principles,
and others of the people of colour, who had no stake
in the country, but embraced similar opinions respecting
liberty and equality. Their opponents
consisted of the white inhabitants and persons of
colour who adhered to the old form of government.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
To the former party, in the course of time, were
added the revolted negroes, who had doubtless been
instigated by them, and after the promulgation of
the decree declaring a general emancipation, they
were joined by the greater proportion, if not by the
whole of that class. To the latter party a few
only of the mulattoes, and a very small body of
negroes, remained attached; added to which were the
British forces which, from the end of the year 1793
to the evacuation in 1798, at different periods were
landed.</p>

<p>To strengthen the former party, and to weaken
the latter, the decrees of the national assembly of
France materially contributed, whilst the proceedings
of the general colonial and provincial assemblies,
instead of giving to the latter any support,
had a contrary effect, by inducing many of the people
of colour, who had espoused it, to hoist the
national cockade, and become active members of
the republican party, thereby giving the cause of
the royalists a fatal blow. It will be perceived
that most of these proceedings of the two parties in
the contest occurred before the British forces had
been called in; and that the emancipation of the
slaves was simultaneous with their arrival and an
act of the French commissioners to strengthen the
national cause against the royalists and the British.
Now as the agents or emigrants of the royalist party
who had gone to England, and as the negotiations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
of M. Charmilly took place at the very period when
the hopes of his party rested upon so insecure a
foundation, it seems to me something like deception
was practised, and that the British government were
not correctly informed of the actual state of the
cause which they were engaging to support; and it
is under this impression, an impression founded
upon the authority of persons who were actually
engaged in all the scenes of active operations which
took place from the first arrival of the British to
the termination of their proceedings under the Honourable
Brigadier-General Maitland, that I venture
to charge the French planters and their party
with that want of unanimity which M. Charmilly,
their accredited representative, assured the British
commander displayed itself through most parts of
the colony.</p>

<p>If an impartial review be taken of the whole of
the conduct of the French planters during the contest
in which they were embroiled, it will become
evident that no blame can be attached to the British
commanders who were successively employed.
They had to contend against a variety of conflicting
opinions and unexampled sickness, and had local
difficulties to surmount of great magnitude. They
evinced on all occasions superior military judgment,
undaunted courage, and unwearied zeal, and exhibited
the greatest prudence and discretion in moments
of no ordinary anxiety.</p>

<p>The calamitous disease which prevailed amongst
the troops, was itself almost enough to dispirit the
most sanguine; and it is not to be wondered at, that
men who met death bravely in the field, should
have shrunk from its approaches when it thus appeared
in all its hideous forms amongst their comrades.</p>

<p>Such was the state of things in the colony at the
close of the year 1798, and with which I shall conclude
this chapter.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class="pch">The period between the evacuation by the British forces
and the arrival of the French army under Le Clerc.&mdash;Cultivation.&mdash;Law
to enforce it.&mdash;Character of Toussaint.&mdash;Reverses.&mdash;His
arrangement with the French
general.&mdash;His seizure and removal to France.</p>

<p class="pn2"><span class="smcap">The</span> evacuation of the colony by the British troops
having taken place, most of the planters who had
been faithful to their engagements departed at the
same time, taking with them such moveable property
as they were enabled to carry away: many
proceeded to Jamaica, and others to Cuba and
the United States. Toussaint L’Ouverture was
thus left in full possession of the island, and in
the undisturbed enjoyment of the chief command,
with which he had been invested some time before
by the French republic. The adherents to the British,
except such as had previously left the island
under the protection of the English squadron, having
joined the national standard, every thing seemed
to have the appearance of tranquillity. Peace succeeded
the din of arms and the asperities of civil
war.</p>

<p>Having, therefore, completely subjugated the
party who had been opposed to him, Toussaint commenced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
his work of improvement in the whole department
of his government. Free from the toils of
the complicated warfare in which he had been engaged,
his first care and attention were turned to
the culture of the soil, in which in a short period
he made the most rapid and astonishing progress:
strongly impressed with the conviction that “agriculture
is the main spring, the master sinew of
every great state, the perennial fountain of wealth”,
he began to enforce a rigid attention to all its
branches, and by every possible means to place it in
that highly productive condition in which it stood
previously to the revolution. Many of the planters
who had joined his standard were reinvested with
their estates, but without any property in the slaves,
and they were encouraged by him to persevere in
the cultivation of their lands, assured of his protection
and of the early adoption of such regulations
as should enable them to procure cultivators. He
seems to have possessed a very correct idea of the
true source from whence national wealth was obtained,
and he left no measures untried that would
in the least promote its increase. He had heard, and
appeared firmly to believe “that rural or agricultural
labours are equally conducive to health and strength
of body and mind. The culture of the earth constitutes
the most natural and innocent employment of
man; it fills our houses with plenty and our hearts
with gladness.” He never allowed an opportunity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
to escape him of shewing how indelibly this maxim
was imprinted on his mind. It may, however, be
well imagined, that after five or six years’ relaxation
from the labours of the field, those who had been
accustomed to it in a state of slavery, were not at
all disposed to return of their own accord to their
original occupations; and as he well knew that his
negro brethren could not be easily induced to labour,
and that some degree of coercion would be
requisite to enforce it, he began to issue strict injunctions,
that every one not employed in any military
capacity should labour in the cultivation of the
lands held not only by the government, but by such
of the planters as had been restored to their estates.</p>

<p>The planters were compelled to receive them on
their plantations in the capacity of servants, and
the cultivators were ordered by the government to
make choice of their employers under whom they
were destined to work for their sustenance, and were
not on any consideration permitted to leave the properties
on which they in the first instance agreed to
labour, unless their services were required in the
army. The government had fixed a remuneration
for the cultivators equal to one-third of the crops,
but there were many who made other arrangements
more suitable to the views of parties, and by which,
also, each was accommodated. Such a law as this,
and enforced so immediately after the cessation of
civil war, when the minds of the negroes were scarcely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
cool, was a strong illustration of the power which
Toussaint held over them, and of his conviction,
that nothing could be accomplished in the advancement
of agriculture unless he at once adopted powerful
and rigid measures. He therefore enacted
laws and regulations to encourage and excite industry,
while he denounced very heavy penalties against
idleness and vagrancy.</p>

<p>This celebrated edict for the enforcing of the
culture of the soil appeared in the year 1800, and
it subsequently formed a leading part of the Code
Henry of Christophe. It embraces every object
that could possibly be conceived likely to promote
his great aim; and whilst its enactments might
have the appearance of severity, unpalatable to the
people just emerged from slavery, so great was his
influence that he felt no alarm for the consequences
of enforcing them; and those who had the temerity
to infringe them were visited with the whole weight
of the penalties.</p>

<p>This law apportions the hours of labour for the
cultivator, which by the 22d article appears in every
point the same as that which is exacted from the
slave in the British islands, that is to say, it commences
at the break of day and concludes at night,
allowing an interval of an hour for breakfast, and
another of two hours at noon, or thereabouts. It
provides against any innovations, and precludes the
labourer or the proprietor from the chance of imposing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
on each other. I see nothing ambiguous in it, it
is clear in the letter, and the spirit of it cannot be erroneously
interpreted. From the 113th to the 120th
article inclusive, it appears beyond the possibility of
contradiction, that Toussaint was conscious that nothing
could be done in the work of the soil without
such forcible regulations as would command the
most strict attention to tillage.</p>

<p>It is quite clear that the labour which this law
exacted each day from the cultivator was not oppressive,
nor have I been able to discover that the
slaves in the British colonial possessions ever complained
of the labour to which they were subjected,
as having been too severe; and it is undeniable
that Toussaint, under the very law which has been
cited, compelled the same portion to be done, and
that for the better insuring its performance, military
guards were placed to superintend the labourers and
to seize those who endeavoured to evade their duty.
That they could not have been injured by labour,
and that they did not murmur at its quantum is
tolerably clear, for it is said by a writer of some repute,
that “the plantation negroes were in general
contented, healthful, and happy”; and that this was
their condition I am assured by the concurring testimony
of men who had witnessed their state at that
period. Is it not the case also in the British colonies?
Are not the slaves on the plantations in the
time of crop, when the labour is perhaps heavier than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
at any other period, “contented, healthful, and
happy”? Most unquestionably they are; I never
saw them otherwise than “contented and happy”,
except at the moment when some insidious and intriguing
person was attempting to estrange them,
and to impress them with the idea that they were
degraded and debased.</p>

<p>If degradation accompanied labour, the cultivators
under Toussaint were the most abject people in existence,
for they were driven to it under the strong
arm of military power, and for any offence which
they committed they were liable to be brought before
a military tribunal. There were no civil authorities
by which the indolent or refractory cultivator
was to be tried for his offences; there was no
distinction between the vagrant who was detected
in idleness and the soldier who fled from his post,
they were both amenable to the military power, were
sentenced by a court-martial, and awarded an equal
punishment.</p>

<p>Possessed of no mean capacity and judgment,
he knew the character and the dispositions of his
negro brethren, and so nicely did he discern and
reward industry, and discriminate between the active
and meritorious and the indolent and the
worthless, that, although in some cases his judgment
was harsh, it was admitted to be just. His
plans were allowed to have been devised with
great skill, and his regulations produced the happiest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
results, which soon became manifest throughout
the whole colony. His agricultural improvements
excited the astonishment and surprise of his
greatest enemies, for in a short period after he commenced
his system, the most beneficial results became
visible; and notwithstanding the protracted
warfare in which he had been engaged, and the devastation
caused by it, he produced a crop equal to
one-third of the quantity of the best year of the
French planters.</p>

<p>He was extremely attentive to the state of the
population, which he was anxious to increase by
every possible means. He held out to those who
had emigrated during the contest, every encouragement
to return, pledging himself to reinstate them
in their properties, and assuring them that their
agricultural avocations should receive all the support
which it was possible for him to afford. This
had a very happy effect, and many returned and
brought with them the slaves who had accompanied
them in their flight, but who of course became free
on their landing. He also endeavoured to impress
the people with a sense of their improper conduct
when they addicted themselves to sensuality and
voluptuousness, and made great efforts to prevent
its extension, by recommending marriage throughout
his country: he was aware of the evil effects of
the system of polygamy which prevailed amongst his
brethren, and knew that it was a severe check on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
increase of population, for he had discovered innumerable
instances in which the offsprings were but
few, where concubinage was so unlimited; and after
a short time, it became evident that an increased
population resulted from his salutary regulations.</p>

<p>With regard to the general character of this extraordinary
man I have but little to say in addition
to what has been already recorded of him. I am
however inclined to believe that his biographers
speak of him with too much warmth, and would
have it believed that he was almost without a fault.
Whatever may be the prevailing opinion, he has
left indelible marks behind him which prove that he
was revengeful and sanguinary in the field; and the
atrocities and cruelties which he exercised over
those mulattoes who fell into his hands, are demonstrative
of no little ferocity of disposition. It has
been argued in exculpation, that surrounded as he
was with people of that class who adhered to his
cause, and who, he expected, might revolt and join
the standard of his enemies, it was a matter of absolute
expediency, that he should resort to the severest
measures to deter them from deserting his
standard, or from engaging in any enterprise inimical
to his cause. But in all his actions he seemed to
be actuated by a determination to exact the most
rigid acquiescence in his will and a complete acknowledgment
of his supreme power, and to establish
which, true it is, he had at times recourse to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
very harsh and cruel measures, which, although effectual
for a time, nevertheless proved injurious to
the peace and security of his government afterwards.</p>

<p>Rainsford, who is no mean authority, for he had
personal knowledge of Toussaint, says, that he was
a man without those unrelenting feelings which
others ascribe to him; but this opinion may proceed
from gratitude on the part of that officer, who was
set at liberty by Toussaint after having been in prison
for a considerable period, and in momentary
expectation of the forfeiture of his life. Speaking
of him in his general character, and of his actions
in the field, he says: “Thus proceeded this illustrious
man, like the simple acorn, first promiscuously
scattered by the winds, in its slow but beauteous
progress to the gigantic oak, spreading its foliage
with august grandeur above the minor growth of the
forest, defending the humble shrub, and braving the
fury of the contending elements.” And again, as if
the author would wish to find a cover for the many
massacres which Toussaint had sanctioned and indulged
in, he says: “When the cloud, charged
with electric fluid, becomes too ponderous, it selects
not the brooding murderer on the barren heath, but
bursts perhaps indiscriminately in wasteful vengeance
over the innocent flocks reposing in verdant
fields. He was, without doubt, a man possessed of
many virtues, and performed many very good and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
very generous acts, and, what must be admitted to
have redounded greatly to his reputation, he was
always grateful, and never left an obligation unrequited.
To those planters whom he induced to return
to the island, and whom he restored to their
properties, he was generous, kind, and indulgent;
and of the confidence which they placed in his assurances,
they had never cause to repent. Taking
him altogether, he was undoubtedly a most extraordinary
character, and whatever might have been the
extent of his vices, they were certainly counter-balanced
and atoned for by many virtues.”</p>

<p>It is said of him by another writer, who seems to
have been conversant with all his private and public
acts, that “the excellences of his character unfolded
themselves more and more, as opportunities were
afforded for their developement. The same humanity
and benevolence which had adorned his humble
life, continued to distinguish him in his elevation.
He never imitated the conduct of other leaders, in
flattering the multitude, encouraging them in crimes,
or urging them to revenge and slaughter; on the
contrary, mercy, industry, and order were always
inculcated by his counsels, recommended by his example,
and enforced by his authority. The fertility
of his inventions, the correctness of his judgments,
the celerity of his movements, the extent of his labours
in the combined and multifarious business of
war and government astonished both friends and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
foes.”<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> And in another place it is observed of him:
“If there was one trait in his character more conspicuous
than the rest, it was his unsullied integrity.
That he never broke his word, was a proverbial expression
common in the mouths of the white inhabitants
of the island, and of the English officers who
were employed in hostilities against him.”</p>

<p>Immediately after the business of the war had
been completed, Toussaint proceeded to the restoration
of public worship, according to the forms
which existed prior to the revolution, and he even
extended the liberty of religious worship beyond the
Roman communion, by admitting one or two of the
Methodist persuasion, who had arrived from the
United States, to the privilege of preaching in Cape
François, and to whom he gave every protection.</p>

<p>His military establishment was on a scale of some
extent during the war, but was much reduced at the
peace. The discipline of his troops did him great
credit, and excited considerable surprise in the British
officers; their movements were effected with
great precision, and although they were not after
the manner of European evolutions, yet they were
well adapted for that species of irregular warfare in
which they were engaged. The men were under
tolerable command, and no symptoms of insubordination
were known to have shewn themselves; they
seemed to be aware of the consequences that would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
ensue to their cause if order and submission were
not rigidly exacted, and they were therefore taught
to obey their officers as a duty indispensable for their
security.</p>

<p>The country generally was so intersected and
varied with underwood and mountains of difficult
ascent, that more reliance was placed on the movements
of irregular bodies detached in small parties,
than on any thing that could be accomplished by
the more steady operations of heavy masses. Such
being the mode of warfare best calculated to meet
the obstacles presented to military operations, Toussaint
sought to drill his troops in such evolutions as
would enable him effectually to meet the exigencies
with which he might have to contend. He had them
taught expertness, promptitude and dexterity, and
quick and steady firing, without any attention to
those movements in column which are so much practised
in Europe. It is said of them, that “at a
whistle a whole brigade would run three or four
hundred yards, then separating, throw themselves
flat on the ground, changing to their backs or sides,
keeping up a strong fire the whole of the time till
they were recalled; then they would form again in
an instant with their wonted regularity. This single
manœuvre used to be executed with such facility
and precision as totally to prevent cavalry from
charging them in bushy and hilly countries.” This
system is nearly similar to the one practised by our
rifle and light infantry corps in England, and decidedly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
best adapted for any operations in the colonies,
where the country presents so rugged and uneven
a surface. The amount of his force has been
variously stated, and I do not conceive it possible
to give a fair estimate of the whole during the time
of the war: his peace establishment consisted of
about forty thousand foot and two thousand cavalry,
all of which were well equipped, and at all times
in readiness for active service.</p>

<p>In the organization of his government, and in
the framing of his constitution and laws, Toussaint
was assisted by some able men from America
and Europe. He never allowed any prejudices
against white persons to influence him, when their
services were required, nor did he permit any of the
superior officers of his government to shew any disrespect
towards them, but he exacted the most
courtly attention to them as the most likely means
to secure the aid of men of learning, whatever
may have been their country or their calling. It
was by this that he induced the able Molière and
M. Marinit, as well as several well-informed English
and Americans to reside near him; to these he was
kind and liberal, obtaining from them the greatest
assistance in the organization of his municipal governments,
and in the whole arrangement of the
different departments of state, as well as in forming
regulations for the better insuring to his country
a commercial intercourse with strangers, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
which all his efforts in cultivating the soil
would have been unavailing; for without a vent for
the products there would have been no stimulus
for the exertions of the grower, and one of the
sources of national wealth would consequently have
been dried up. His tour through the Spanish part
of the island was attended with considerable advantage
to him, for it infused a kind of confidence
into the people, by whom he was received in every
part with great respect, and often with every demonstration
of joy. This is not surprising, for the
fame of his deeds and his warlike achievements and
his deportment, which is said to have been mild and
courtly, were likely to excite favourable sentiments,
and to elicit a good deal of applause. This tour
was certainly one of necessity, and not undertaken
from any vain parade and ostentation; for the
Spanish part of the island, although formally ceded
to France by the treaty of 1795, had not all been
occupied by the republican forces. The city of
Santo Domingo, a place of considerable strength,
and surrounded with fortifications sufficiently powerful
to resist any attack that might have been made
upon it, still held out, and it was not until the arrival
of Toussaint in 1801, with a large force, that
a legal surrender of the whole Spanish division was
finally accomplished. Having succeeded in this, he
left his brother Paul in command, and then pursued
his journey through the other districts, establishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
posts, appointing officers to command them, with
other important military and civil arrangements,
which he deemed necessary for the purpose of
governing more easily the whole of that part of the
island. Having completed this tour, which was
attended with much benefit to every part of the
island which he visited, he began to hope for some
repose from the fatigues attendant on such multifarious
occupations, which might enable him to
cultivate the sweets of peace and retirement, as
well as to see all those designs fully completed, and
which had for their object, the enriching of his
country and the happiness of his people.</p>

<p>The end of the year 1801 placed the whole island
once more in some degree of tranquillity, and in
submission to the authority of the negro chief,
rapidly advancing in wealth and increasing its
intercourse with those countries which sought to
establish with it the friendly relations of commerce.
But the short peace of Amiens, which took place in
October of that year, leaving the then ruler in
France, Bonaparte, without any power to contend
with, his first object was the recovery of Saint
Domingo. Wanting employment for his large
armies, and instigated by the fugitive colonists who
had been expelled at the commencement of the
revolution, and who were anxiously longing for
their lost possessions; thirsting also for colonies
and commerce, and urged by the speculators in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
France, he determined on subjugating the island
by force, reestablishing slavery, and reinstating
the ex-colonists in their original properties. To
accomplish these objects by force rather than by
negotiation, was more congenial to the temper and
martial spirit of the French ruler. He therefore
began to make extensive preparations for an undertaking,
which he vainly thought could not fail
ultimately to gain new laurels for his troops, and
exalt himself more than ever in the estimation of
the people of France, who were always forward
to reward him for any successes which accompanied
his efforts, with no ordinary demonstrations
of joy.</p>

<p>This expedition consisted of twenty-six sail of
the line, on board of which were embarked 25,000
men, under the command of the brother-in-law of
Bonaparte, General Le Clerc, seconded by some
of the ablest generals of France, and many other
officers of distinction who were conversant with
the island, and who formerly held properties in
it. Not, however, relying entirely on what such
a force might be able to execute, the First Consul
had recourse to a measure which he concluded would
insure the neutrality of Toussaint, if it did not
induce him to lend him an active cooperation.
Two of the sons of the negro chief had been sent
to France for their education, for the purpose of
giving them the opportunity of following a course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
of studies, which might prepare them to fill, with
advantage to their country, those important posts
for which they seemed destined. Taken from their
preceptor by orders of the First Consul, they were
hurried on board the fleet, to be made as it were to
intercede with their father, and, if possible, to
prevail on him to accede to such proposals as the
commander-in-chief of the expedition was empowered
to offer; and, in fact, they were placed as
hostages in the hands of the French commanders,
and thus made amenable for any hostile steps which
their father might be disposed to take.</p>

<p>The expedition arrived in the bay of Sumana, in
the eastern extremity of the island, on the 25th of
January, 1802, when, without the least delay,
General Le Clerc distributed his force into three
divisions, which were to make simultaneous attacks
on three distinct parts of the colony. One division
was directed to disembark and take possession of
the city of Santo Domingo, and was commanded
by General Kerseran; another, under General Boudet,
was sent to Port au Prince; whilst the commander-in-chief
proceeded with the remainder of
the troops to the south side, when a part was landed
at Mansenillo Bay, under General Rochambeau;
and the principal body with Le Clerc, and his personal
staff intended to disembark at Cape François,
for the purpose of gaining possession of that city.</p>

<p>Toussaint had been apprised of the intentions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
the French government to send out a force to Saint
Domingo, but of its extent, its nature, and its
ulterior designs, he had no knowledge. He merely
conjectured, that it had no hostile object, and that
it was just such a force as might have been expected
would be sent by the parent state, for the better
insuring the peace and obedience of the colony.
That such was his impression I think there is great
reason to believe, for he issued his orders to all his
generals at their respective posts, commanding them
to receive the French troops without suspicion; and
his proclamation called upon the people to admit
them as friends. Others again seem to infer that
he not only knew that the designs of the consular
cabinet were inimical to the existing order of
things in the colony, but that he knew the extent
of the means which were to be employed in their
execution. If this latter were the fact, then that
caution, vigilance, and activity which had marked
his former career, had entirely forsaken him, for it
is evident he made no preparations for the reception
of a force entertaining hostile intentions.</p>

<p>I shall not go through the whole detail of the
landing of this armament at the different points
selected for that purpose, but I shall offer a short
sketch of the general operations which followed.</p>

<p>Whatever might have been the instructions given
by the First Consul to Le Clerc, the latter did not
appear the least disposed to try the effect of negotiation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
before he displayed some intentions of hostility,
for General Rochambeau, who landed in the
neighbourhood of Fort Dauphin, formed his troops
on the beach, and the negroes, who had been led
by the proclamation of their governor-general to
believe that they had landed as friends, ran in
crowds to witness the disembarkation, and with the
most friendly demonstrations welcomed their arrival.
But Rochambeau, most dastardly and inhumanly,
without the slightest intimation of what was to follow,
charged them at the point of the bayonet, when
a great many were slaughtered, and the rest with
difficulty fled to places of protection, leaving the
fort in possession of the French. This took place
on the 2d of February, two days before the arrival of
the commander-in-chief in the harbour of Cape
François, and as the account of it soon reached the
city, General Christophe, who commanded there,
was enabled to prepare for its defence, and at once
discovered, that instead of coming as friends, this
force had arrived for the purpose of subjugation.</p>

<p>By this premature commencement at Fort Dauphin,
Le Clerc was foiled in his design of taking
the black general by surprise, or in playing off any
of those stratagems and intrigues so characteristic
of a Frenchman. From the intelligence which he
had received of the movements of Rochambeau,
Christophe was instantly on the qui vive. Wary
and watchful, he disposed of his men judiciously,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
strengthening the most vulnerable points, and encouraging
his troops to meet every attack with
courage and fortitude, setting to them an example
of confidence in their own power, which animated
them to the most surprising efforts. He also intimated
to the inhabitants of the city, that their lives
would be inevitably held as a security for the hostile
proceedings of the French armament, and that
he would never surrender the place so long as a
single habitation remained standing. This threat
of the negro general produced the most appalling
sensations, because they were aware of the intentions
of the French being hostile, and they were
also sensible, that there would be no abatement of
the dreadful denunciation of the black commander.
To avert the dreadful alternative, a select body of
the inhabitants, headed by the municipal authorities,
were deputed to wait upon the French commander-in-chief,
and to implore him to desist from
hostile operations, until such time as their safety
could be provided for, as it was the determination
of Christophe to sacrifice them, and to destroy the
city, should any attack proceed from the French
force. Le Clerc gave them no assurances that he
would desist from offensive measures; he received
them, however, courteously, and advised them to
return to the city, and take with them the proclamation
which he was about to issue, and give it every
publicity in their power. He also told them in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
most specious way, that the object of his force was
not the restoration of slavery, but the preservation
of the colony in obedience to the consular government
of France, without in any way interfering
with or infringing upon the rights of the people, as
now admitted; but rather to fix those rights on a
more permanent basis, and to secure them against
innovation. To such flattering communications the
deputation listened with easy credulity, and returned
to the city buoyed up with the delusive hope
that their lives and properties would be protected,
and that the lamentable catastrophe resulting from
retaliatory measures would be effectually averted.</p>

<p>The proclamation of Bonaparte, couched in his
usual ambiguous style, was intended no doubt to deceive
the negro population by confirming their rights
to be free and equal, whilst at the same time the real
object of the expedition was the restoration of slavery,
and the restitution of the colony to its condition
previously to the revolution. Having pledged however
his faith to the negroes, that they should enjoy
that freedom which had been conferred upon
them, they were at the same time told, that in the
event of their rejection of the terms which the
commander-in-chief was empowered to offer, violence
would be resorted to, and the pledge withdrawn.
It may not be improper to insert a translation
of this proclamation, which will thus speak
for itself.&mdash;</p>

the French, and have sworn to them peace
and amity; the French people too, have embraced
each other, and have sworn to be all friends and
brothers. Come also, embrace the French, and
rejoice to see again your friends and brothers of
Europe.</p>

<p>“The government sends you Captain-General
Le Clerc; he brings with him numerous forces for
protecting you against your enemies, and against
the enemies of the republic. If it be said to you,
these forces are destined to ravish from you your
liberty, answer, the republic will not suffer it to be
taken from us.</p>

<p>“Rally round the Captain-General; he brings
you peace and plenty. Rally all of you around
him. Whoever shall dare to separate himself from
the Captain-General will be a traitor to his country,
and the indignation of the republic will devour
him, as the fire devours your dried canes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Such a document as the preceding, promulgated
too at a moment when an extraordinary panic had
arisen from the extent of the French force, about
to commence its operations simultaneously from
several points, was not likely to pass without making
a very deep impression on those whose minds were
vacillating and unfixed, and who had refrained from
declaring themselves until they were informed as
to the views of the French government with regard
to the future administration of the colony, in
the event of their being successful. This proclamation
was received by the wavering among the
negro population as one of great sincerity, assuring
them that they had nothing to apprehend about
their being again destined for slavery. Many therefore
embraced the offers which it held out, and
joined the standard of the invaders, and Le Clerc,
anticipating further submissions before Toussaint
arrived, determined on the commencement of active
measures so soon as he should be informed that
Rochambeau, having effected a successful landing,
was advancing upon the city. He did not however
land his forces till he had tried the effect of
an epistolary communication with General Christophe,
the commander at the Cape, in which in the
true Gascon style of invective and threat, Le Clerc
informs that individual, that unless he immediately
accedes to the landing of his forces, he will “hold
him (Christophe) responsible for what may happen.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>Christophe was not to be entrapped. Firm, inflexible,
and determined in his conduct, he returned
an answer to the French commander couched in
language which could bear but one interpretation,
that he would make every possible resistance to the
French arms, and that they should not enter “Cape
Town until it was reduced to ashes.” “Nay,” says
he, “even in the ruins I will renew the combat.”
Again he says, “How can you hold me responsible
for the event? you are not my chief. I know you
not; and can therefore take no account of you, till
you are acknowledged by Governor Toussaint.”</p>

<p>Immediately after this correspondence had taken
place, Le Clerc made preparations for landing, which
he effected promptly in the neighbourhood of Da
Limbe and the Bay of Acul, no great distance to the
westward of the city. Le Clerc’s object seems to have
been to gain the heights round the Cape, before the
negroes could effectually carry their threat of devastation
by fire and sword into execution. These
movements were anticipated by the negro general,
who therefore prepared to intercept them. Knowing
that the white inhabitants were wavering and
faithless, and that he could not confide in them
were he to permit their neutrality, and being fully
aware that many mulattoes, and even negroes, were
secretly inclined towards the French, he without
hesitation commenced the work of conflagration,
which he had previously given them to understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
would be done the moment the French set their foot
on shore in an hostile manner. The order being
given, was obeyed with alacrity, and both Le Clerc
and Admiral Villaret, when they came within sight
of the city saw the devastation which was likely to
ensue. The French commanders made great efforts
to save the town, and the crews of the ships were
landed for that purpose, but they were only able to
save a few buildings from the destructive element.</p>

<p>The part of Christophe’s threat most dreaded
was the massacre of the inhabitants of the city, but
to his credit be it said, he did not put it in execution.
True no doubt it is that he carried off a great
many whom he intended to hold as hostages for the
conduct of the French; but it is not recorded that
he treated them with any barbarity, or that he executed
any of them. After this the negro general
retreated with his forces, and took up a strong position
until he was joined by the Governor-General
Toussaint.</p>

<p>Having arrived a short time after the fall of the
Cape, and having previously issued orders to all
his subordinate generals to prepare for the most
active defence against the French arms, Toussaint
personally inspected every post, and minutely surveyed
every position in which it was practicable to
make a successful stand against his opponents.</p>

<p>It was at this time, and whilst he was at his seat
at Ennery, about thirty miles from the Cape, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
his two sons were presented to him to try how far
another attempt at fraud, sophistry, and hypocrisy
might succeed. I shall not attempt to go through the
whole detail of the scenes which took place between
the wily tutor Coisnon, the affectionate children, the
fond father, and the tender mother; let it suffice,
however, to state that they failed of their wonted
success, for Toussaint was inflexible. I cannot resist
the temptation of quoting a passage from a writer,
who describes the tender interview which took place
between them. “The two sons ran to meet their
father, and he with emotions too big for utterance,
clasped them silently in his arms. Few it is to be
hoped are the partakers of our common nature, who,
on witnessing the embraces and tears of parental
and filial sensibility, could have proceeded at least
without powerful relentings of heart, to execute the
commission with which Coisnon was charged.”</p>

<p>But this cold-blooded emissary of France beheld
the scene with a barbarous apathy, worthy of the
cause in which he was employed. When the first
burst of paternal feeling was over, Toussaint
stretched out his arms to him, whom he regarded
with complacency as the tutor of his children,
and their conductor to the roof and embraces of
their parents. This was the moment which Coisnon
thought most favourable to the perpetration of his
treacherous design. “The father and the two sons”,
says he, “threw themselves into each other’s arms.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
I saw them shed tears, and wishing to take advantage
of a period which I conceived to be favourable,
I stopped him at the moment when he stretched
out his arms to me.”</p>

<p>The crafty and unfeeling Coisnon thought that
the most favourable moment had arrived for opening
the business of his mission, and without delay entered
upon it by addressing the chief, and imploring
him to reflect upon the consequences that would
inevitably result from any hostile measures against
the power of Bonaparte, as any resistance to so powerful
a force, composed of troops that had always been
elated with victory, must prove unavailing. On the
other hand, he pledged the sincerity with which his
master was actuated, spoke of the admiration which
Toussaint’s conduct had excited, and of the distinguished
valour and judgment which he had displayed
in the multifarious operations of the war. He also
held out to him the most attractive, yet delusive,
promises of what would ensue from his joining the
French standard, and the vengeance that would
doubtless accompany any act of hostility; and,
finally, he handed to the negro chief the letter, of
which he was the bearer, written by Bonaparte in his
own hand, and teeming with expressions which might
have moved the resolution of more determined men
than Toussaint. But that cautious, unbending, and
inflexible man was on his guard against the snare
that was laid to entrap him, and the cunning tutor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
was necessitated to try the effect of a more powerful
agency, the intercession of his children and the entreaties
of his wife. Bonaparte, in his letter to the
chief, tries what effect an allusion to the former will
have. “We have made known to your children,
and to their preceptor,” he says, “the sentiments by
which we are animated. We send them back to you.
Assist with your counsel, your influence, and your
talents, the captain-general. What can you desire?
The freedom of the blacks? You know that in all
the countries we have been in, we have given it to
the people who had it not. Do you desire consideration,
honours, fortune? It is not after the services
you have rendered, the services you can still render,
<i>and with the personal estimation we have for you,
that you ought to be doubtful with respect to your
consideration, your fortune, and the honours that
await you</i>.” Such an appeal might have had some
influence and power over a vain man, and the feelings
of the father might have been softened when the
eloquence of the preceptor pleaded in behalf of the
children, whose lives would be the forfeit of the non-compliance
of the parent. But this would not do,
nor would the subsequent artless appeal of the tutored
children, aided by the faithful mother, from
whose tears the savage Coisnon prematurely looked
for success. All were unavailing, and Toussaint,
after having composed himself, and assumed an appearance
of ease and confidence, took the preceptor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
by the hand; then directing the others to retire, he
said to him, with a stern and dignified manner,
“Take back my children, since it must be so. I
will be faithful to my brethren and my God.”</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the failure of Coisnon’s mission,
a truce was agreed upon for a few days, for the
purpose of carrying on a correspondence between
Le Clerc and Toussaint, to try if the horrors of
war might not be averted by mutual concessions.
Le Clerc anticipated a favourable result, but
Toussaint’s reply contained no augury of his submission
to the will of the chief consul. The truce,
therefore, being at an end, each of the chiefs prepared
for active operations, and Toussaint and Christophe
were declared to be enemies of the French
republic, and all persons were called upon to seize
them.</p>

<p>Every art and every stratagem was now devised
by Le Clerc, which might entice over the negroes
to his cause; and he therefore first held out assurances
to their officers of rank and preferment in the
French army, and to the negroes themselves he gave
the most solemn promise that their freedom should
be respected and preserved inviolate. Another circumstance
also, which very materially contributed to
the successes which Le Clerc gained, was, that the
cultivators throughout the colony had had enough of
war, and had determined to remain neutral in the
pending struggle, so long as their properties were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
insured to them, and their remaining inactive was
permitted. Consequently, Le Clerc having nothing
to apprehend from them, was at liberty to turn the
whole of his attention against the organized forces of
the negro chiefs; and, to oppose these, required no
little skill and manœuvre, from the great obstacles
which the face of the country presented to European
forces, inured only to a systematic mode of fighting,
whilst the negro soldiers were thoroughly instructed
in skirmishing, bush fighting, and every other irregular
mode of warfare. For such operations as these,
they were in the highest possible order, both as to
discipline and equipments. They knew well how to
manage their artillery, were quick in firing, and no
bad marksmen. All their movements were effected
with amazing rapidity, and from one point of communication
to another they flew with the greatest
celerity. The French seemed astonished at the
quickness with which they performed their movements,
and at times when they thought victory certain,
found themselves unexpectedly opposed to a
body, who made the most desperate attack upon them,
and forced them to retire completely discomfited.
They also had another advantage over the European
troops; neither the scorching heat of the sun, nor
the pernicious influence of the night air, had any
injurious effects upon them, whilst the French were
suffering severely from the evil consequences of both.
Although one day they might have sustained a defeat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
still, on the next, the negro soldiers appeared
in force before their enemy, prepared to renew the
combat. Not so with the French; for the severity
of the duties of the field was insupportable, and on
many occasions, when they had gained advantages,
their fatigue was so great that they were unable to
follow them up, and thereby throw their opponents
into disorder and confusion.</p>

<p>The principal exertions of the French troops commenced
in the plains of the north, just after the
truce had expired, and about the 20th of February,
by an attack on Plaisance, which place having surrendered,
the black commander and his soldiers,
consisting of five hundred infantry and cavalry,
joined the French standard. Marmalade followed,
having been defended a short time by Christophe,
who was at last obliged to retreat, in consequence of
the treachery of one of his officers who had surrendered
an important position on his line, and had followed
the example of the commander at Plaisance.</p>

<p>In the neighbourhood of Port Paix, the French
troops, under Humbert, sustained a check; and on
the 20th of February the troops under General Debelle
were obliged to retire, after having sustained
some loss.</p>

<p>The division of General Boudet having landed at
Port au Prince, left that city, and proceeded against
La Croix des Bouquets, where the celebrated Dessalines
had taken up a position; but on the approach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
of the French force he set fire to the place, and the
next day, by a most extraordinary and rapid movement
across the mountains, appeared before Leogane,
to which place he also set fire, notwithstanding
the resistance offered by a French frigate which lay
in sight, and which had been sent thither to insure
its safety. The movements of this chief were the
most surprising; one day he was found in the plains
of the Cul de Sac, acting with the most determined
bravery, and committing dreadful ravages in the
face of the French army; and the next, he was found
in the plains of Leogane committing similar excesses,
avoiding, in both, coming in contact with the enemy
in the open field. Bush fighting, and setting fire to
the plantations, to impede the advance of the enemy
and destroy their provisions, was his only aim, and
in this he seems to have been unusually fortunate
and successful.</p>

<p>One of the black chiefs, La Plume, who had retreated
before Generals Desfourneaux and Hardy
from the vicinity of Plaisance, surrendered, with all
his troops, to General Boudet, which compensated
for the losses which the French had sustained, and
was a serious, if not a fatal, blow to the negro cause.</p>

<p>On the 24th of February, General Rochambeau
fell in with Toussaint, who had under him about
three thousand men, and had taken up a strong position
in the Ravine à Couleuvre. The attack was commenced
by Rochambeau, and met with great skill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
and courage by the negro general and his troops,
and a most sanguinary conflict ensued. The blacks
fought with the most determined bravery, and the
French made the greatest efforts to exceed them;
and at last, after having lost eight hundred of his
men, who were left dead in the field, Toussaint
thought it prudent to retreat, and take up his position
on the banks of La Petite Rivière. There could
not have been more military skill shewn than was displayed
by the respective commanders in this battle.
The slaughter was immense, and the loss of the
French, it was conjectured, exceeded that of the
negroes; but the latter had no public journals to announce
their triumphs, whilst the former had the
benefit of gazettes and proclamations to extol their
successes, and to magnify the disasters of their opponents.
It is certain that after the action Rochambeau
could not advance, and the black general was
in some measure justified in claiming the victory, as
well as some merit for taking up another position,
particularly as Le Clerc was advancing to cut him
off with a large force; and which seems true enough,
for he took up a line in the vicinity of Gonaives,
with his advance upon the road of St. Marc.</p>

<p>Whatever opinion is entertained of the result of
the battle, its consequences were certainly injurious
to his cause; his retreat was demonstrative of discomfiture,
and such a feeling existed among his
troops, as well as among those of his other divisions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
Under the influence of this feeling, and the allurements
of the French generals, who held out the most
engaging promises, desertions became frequent, and
in one instance the conduct of the black general
Maurepas, who commanded the district of St. Marc,
and who, at the moment that Le Clerc was engaged
in making preparations to compel him to retire from
it, surrendered with his force, consisting of two thousand
men, proved quite decisive of the fate of the
contest.</p>

<p>Declining to enter into a further detail of the
operations in the field, as they consisted chiefly of
irregular warfare, and presented nothing of importance,
I shall merely make a few observations on the
conduct of the respective chiefs who commanded,
and their measures to defeat each other’s design.</p>

<p>I think it must be admitted to be indisputable
that the greatest success was in favour of the French,
and that although some partial advantages were
gained by the blacks, yet they seemed to have no
ultimate chance of prolonging the contest. It is
true that Toussaint, Christophe, and Dessalines
held strong positions, and that it would take a considerable
time to dislodge them, as well as cause a
great sacrifice of human lives. Le Clerc therefore
resorted to every device likely to gain over the
black troops, and the most successful one was, his
promotion of many of those who had previously
joined him, and the practice of an unusual degree of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
mildness towards the remainder, by which he so
much exalted himself in the estimation of the whole,
that the negroes undertook to allure their brethren
to their standard, holding out to them advantages
similar to those which they had themselves gained.
This stratagem succeeding in a very extensive degree,
he was joined by a great number of the troops
of the black chiefs, and a great many laid down their
arms, so that in a short period Toussaint was left
with scarcely any adherents, except those few planters
who suspected the designs of the French, and
correctly dived into the intentions of the French
general. These remained firm to him for a time,
but when one reverse was followed up by another,
and when there was not a visible chance of any further
efforts being likely to succeed, and when his
retirement seemed inevitable, most of these deserted
him, and made their submission to the French commander,
leaving Toussaint to contend against a
variety of difficulties, and to surmount obstacles
sufficient to have reduced the proudest and noblest
spirit to a state of the greatest despair. But even
at this trying period Toussaint’s fortitude never
forsook him. He foresaw that his enemy before
long would find that they had to contend with
greater obstacles than any which his resistance could
present; nor was he mistaken; for in a short time,
Le Clerc, elated by his successful movements,
began to develope the designs with which he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
instructed, and thinking that he had completely
discomfited the whole of the forces of the black
generals, or, at all events, that he had so dispersed
their followers that they could not again appear
before him, he set about executing the great object of
the expedition&mdash;that of restoring the planters who
had accompanied him to their hereditary estates,
and of placing the negroes once more under their
control, reviving their ancient property in them, and
pledging the French government to resist all future
attempts that might be made to disturb them.</p>

<p>It is impossible to portray the indignation which
this impolitic and base act of Le Clerc so universally
excited. The very planters themselves,
apprehensive of the consequences which so unwise
and so hasty a proceeding was likely to produce,
declined to avail themselves of an offer, the impracticability
of enforcing which seemed to them to be
certain. They were convinced that no good could
result from it; but circumstances of the most painful
and dangerous nature were more likely to arise,
were the general to attempt putting his plans into
execution.</p>

<p>The poor deluded and credulous cultivators, who
had been allured by the promises of their enemy,
now saw their error, and without a moment’s delay
began to consult their own safety, to devise means to
evade the orders of the French commander, and join
their brethren who still adhered to the negro general;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
and finally to aid in defeating such outrageous
proceedings by the most energetic and the most effectual
plan which they had the means of concerting.</p>

<p>Such of the negro troops, also, as had joined the
French under the perfidious pledges of the commander-in-chief,
began to feel considerable anxiety lest
they should be forced to share the fate which seemed
to impend over their black brethren in general. To
revolt, however, appeared almost impossible; they
were not concentrated at any one point, but seemed
to have been placed in small detached bodies, and
were so completely under the control and surveillance
of the French that desertion was difficult, and
in most instances not to be effected without detection,
when they were subjected to the most cruel
punishment.</p>

<p>Toussaint now saw that his predictions were realized,
and that the time had arrived when the scale
of success would turn in his favour, and with that
promptitude which accompanied all his resolutions
and all his plans of operations, he seized the favourable
moment, and with the most extraordinary celerity
formed a junction with Christophe, when they
proceeded towards the north, calling upon the cultivators
on their way to join their cause, and to revenge
the base and unprecedented conduct of the French
general. From all quarters the cultivators flocked
to their standard, and in a few days their force<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
became somewhat imposing; and although they
were armed with such weapons only as could have
been found on the plantations, and had but a short
supply of musquetry, still they moved on by forced
marches with the most surprising rapidity, driving
their enemy from one post to another, without
meeting with the least opposition, until they appeared
before Cape François, which being defended
by a strong force, and covered by the fleet in the
harbour, was saved from the fate which awaited it.</p>

<p>Le Clerc, now shut up in the besieged city of
Cape François, was reduced to the greatest extremities,
and he began to devise means for evacuating
the place, and taking up some position within the
Spanish territory; but a strong reinforcement which
arrived from France somewhat revived his hopes,
although he knew further offensive measures would
not be advisable. The city too, from the number
of people within its walls, began to exhibit symptoms
of a pestilential nature, and the alarm became
most distressing; inhabitants and troops alike became
martyrs to its ravages, and every thing indicated
the most wretched termination of the siege.
Beginning therefore to feel the evil consequences of
his premature and precipitant as well as nefarious
conduct, he began to consult with his officers upon
some plan which might have the effect of putting a
stop to the further prosecution of the impending
struggle: he saw the error he had committed, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
it was necessary that he should recover the position
he held, before he gave his ill-advised and perfidious
orders for the reestablishment of slavery.
To accomplish this, the captain-general had recourse
again to cunning and delusion, and to every
species of trick and artifice which his inventive mind
could suggest: but it was a work of no ordinary
difficulty to restore confidence, and impress the
simple cultivators with an idea of sincerity, after
having been guilty of the most atrocious acts of
treachery and deceit. Something, however, it was
imperative to try, and the usual measure of proclamation
was immediately decided upon as likely to
produce the desired effect.</p>

<p>This proclamation contains the old specious declaration
of “Liberty and Equality to all the
inhabitants of Saint Domingo, without regard to
colour,” and the most abject apology for his conduct
in the late contest, with an assurance that his
future intentions were of the most friendly kind, and
that he ardently desired to reconcile conflicting
opinions, appease internal discord, restore peace
to all classes of people, and place the colony in
the most flourishing and prosperous condition. In
this proclamation a great deal was also said about
a constitution that should be acceptable to the people,
the basis of which was the old term “Liberty
and Equality,” providing however, it appears, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
acceptation of it by the French government, as a
measure of precaution.</p>

<p>It may easily be conjectured that such submissive
expressions of regard and solicitude for the
people would be likely to accomplish the Frenchman’s
purpose, and that the negro population, in their
rude state of ignorance, would not be able to discover
or penetrate into the designs at which he
aimed. That this was the case with the proclamation
of the captain-general, is most evident, for that class
of the people, on its being declared to them by the
emissaries of the French that the reestablishment
of slavery was not contemplated, and that the
French government merely aimed at the sovereignty
over the island, became clamourous for arrangements,
whilst the cultivators who had encountered
much fatigue and inconvenience, and who had been
deprived of those comforts which peace and repose
presented, were equally anxious for some understanding
by which a further prosecution of the war
would be avoided. All classes seemed to concur in
one point, that the only object for which contention
and resistance to the French was justifiable, was the
preservation of that liberty which the representatives
of the French government declared to them
in 1793, and which declaration had been confirmed
by the national assembly of France.</p>

<p>This proclamation, issued by Le Clerc on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
25th of April, 1802, confirming, as they conceived,
their liberty, they did not consider that there
remained further cause for a continuation of the
struggle, for the question of sovereignty was not
one which gave them any concern.</p>

<p>To the wishes of the great body of the people
Toussaint reluctantly submitted, and Dessalines
gave his decided opinion that no negotiations should
be entered into, except for the purpose of receiving
a proposal for the evacuation of the colony by the
French forces. Both these chiefs doubted the sincerity
of the French general, and believed that his
propositions were only intended to cover more
vigorous efforts to crush them hereafter. In the
mean time Christophe found it prudent, from some
symptoms of defection among his troops, to open a
negotiation with Le Clerc, and officers were appointed
for that purpose, when the former demanded a
general amnesty and preservation of his own rank
and property, as well as that of all his compatriots:
the same to extend also to Toussaint and Dessalines.
To this Le Clerc, after some deliberation, but with
no good will, acceded, and the arrangements were
accordingly concluded.</p>

<p>Toussaint and Dessalines, after having reflected
for a short time on their respective situations, and
standing almost alone against the prevailing wish
of the people, consented to the terms which had
been granted to Christophe as a matter both of experiment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
and expediency, and thus for the present
ended the contest, which for the extent of it may
have been justly described as the most cruel and
sanguinary in the annals of warfare. By this peace
the island of St. Domingo is admitted to be under
the sovereignty of France.</p>

<p>The peace being concluded, the cultivators and
proprietors returned to their homes, and recommenced
their labours in the soil, in the pleasing
hope of being permitted to remain in the bosom of
their families, enjoying all those comforts of which
the horrors of war had so long denied them. The
three negro chiefs, Toussaint, Dessalines, and Christophe
retired to their respective plantations, after
having been assured by Le Clerc, with every mark
of sincerity, that their persons and property should
be held sacred, and that instructions should be
transmitted to them, upon which they were to act
in their future military commands. In their retreat,
however, it appears that Dessalines and Christophe
were far from feeling confident of their own safety;
they consequently did not slumber in their retirement;
and being greatly apprehensive of the consequences
of the experiment into which they had
been led, they waited, with no little anxiety, the
result of it.</p>

<p>Credulous, and relying on the captain-general’s
honour, from the confidence which he had inspired,
Toussaint thought of little but the enjoyment of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
repose in the bosom of his family. At his estate
in the vicinity of Gonaives, he took up his abode,
surrounded by his faithful wife and endearing children
(with the exception of his two sons who had
been detained as hostages, and of whose fate no
intelligence was ever received), there to indulge in
the sweets of domestic life, after the toils and the
cares of a protracted civil war, in which he had
borne the most conspicuous part, and shared in all
its extraordinary vicissitudes and all its heart-rending
scenes of death and destruction. But his
retirement was invaded&mdash;the snare was laid for him
by the perfidious Le Clerc, and in the moment of
sleep, unconscious and unsuspecting, he was surrounded
by some troops sent for the purpose, torn
from his bed in the dead of night, torn from his
faithful wife and beloved children, and hurried on
board a frigate, there to remain until preparations
were made for sending him to France. It was useless
and unavailing to make any resistance, or to exclaim
against such treachery and inhumanity: he submitted
to his fate, and left it to his countrymen to
avenge his wrongs. He only asked for the protection
and security of his family, but they became
also the objects of suspicion, and were subsequently
hurried on board the same vessel with
their father. They were all sent to France, and
their tragical end became the subject of general
horror and indignation throughout Europe. Le<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
Clerc, to soften the barbarity and atrocity of this
act, gave it out that Toussaint was plotting against
the French, and was aiming, in conjunction with his
other officers, to seize the first unguarded moment
in which they might be caught, to break the peace,
and to renew the combat with redoubled vigour and
determination.</p>

<p>Thus terminated the career of Toussaint. His
end will ever blacken the pages of French history,
and leave such a stain on the character of its
government that no lapse of time can efface. History
cannot produce a more base and unjustifiable
act of violence; and it is to be hoped, for the sake
of humanity, its perpetrators will meet with that
just execration which so much perfidy and treachery
deserves.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p class="pch">The period from the seizure of Toussaint to the final
expulsion of the French, by Dessalines, in 1803.&mdash;State
of cultivation.&mdash;Commerce declined&mdash;and observations
on the population.&mdash;Its extent.</p>

<p class="pn2"><span class="smcap">The</span> dispute between the people of the island and
the French had now assumed a different character,
for it could no longer be designated a contest between
the revolted slaves of a colony and their
government, but a civil war, originating in an attempt
of oppression on the part of that government,
over those inhabitants whom it had thought proper
to declare to be, “free and equal before God, and
before the republic.” A conflict, I say, emanating
from the basest act of duplicity, and from the most
unexampled breach of faith and confidence that has
been heard of in modern times; a conflict which, in
the sequel, proved the destruction of its authors, and
the expulsion of the French from all property in St.
Domingo. Our minds must be totally divested of
all those impressions which the rebellion of the slaves
at first created; and we must view the future operations
of the contending parties abstractedly, and not
as having any connexion with past events.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>Whatever might have been the instructions given
to the captain-general Le Clerc by his master, that
officer seems to have acted with a degree of precipitancy
that must be condemned. Had the French
ruler been ever so confident in the success of an enterprise
as the one in which he had engaged, as a
soldier and as a general who had commanded in a
series of campaigns, he must have left something
to the discretion of the officer whom he had appointed
to conduct it, and not have insisted on an
implicit obedience to instructions that could only
have been given from a vague knowledge of the scene
on which such enterprise was to be carried into effect.
The success of most offensive operations depends in
a great measure on the local information which a commanding
officer acquires on his arrival at the point
at which such operations are to commence; and a
great deal, therefore, must, I imagine, be left to his
judgment and discretion, without fettering him with
instructions from which he cannot deviate, however
injudicious and inefficient they may become, from the
local obstacles with which he has to contend. Bonaparte
himself, I believe, never acted but as circumstances
pointed out, paying but little attention to the
directions which, from time to time, he received from
the executive government of France. I think it,
therefore, not unfair to draw from this the inference
that, on sending out his brother-in-law, Le Clerc, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
command the expedition to St. Domingo, he vested
in him the power to act as circumstances might
require, and as prudence and discretion might
dictate.</p>

<p>After the outrage which he committed on the
unfortunate Toussaint and his family, the captain-general
began to deliberate on the organization of a
new form of government, and about the end of June,
1802, he issued his regulations for that purpose;
but he had forgotten that the treacherous conduct,
of which he had so recently been guilty, remained
unrevenged, and that the people would not submit
to it with impunity, but resort to measures of retaliation
until they had satiated themselves for the
atrocious deed. These regulations had certainly
nothing in them new; they were merely those of
Toussaint, re-modelled as it were, but they were
prematurely issued, for they only tended to inflame
the more, and to hasten that crisis which began to
threaten the French cause in the colony.</p>

<p>No sooner was the cruel seizure of Toussaint
known, than Dessalines, Christophe, and Clerveaux
flew to arms, collected their scattered forces, called
the cultivators and others to join their standard, to
revenge the outrage committed on their chief, and
to defend themselves against the designs of the
French general. In a few days, they found themselves
at the head of a large body of troops, armed
and well equipped, and determined on a most desperate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
struggle for liberty, and either to expel the
French or perish in the attempt. The French
troops, on the other hand, were hourly diminishing
by various diseases incident to the climate. The
officers were dying daily, and others sunk into an
irrecoverable despondency; and a disaffected spirit
had manifested itself amongst them, through which
not only the privates and subaltern officers deserted
their standards, but even generals followed the example.
The scenes of carnage and destruction
which took place are said to have shocked humanity,
and the atrocities of the French exceeded so much
the executions of their black opponents, that the
latter seem to have entitled themselves to the character
of being merciful when compared with the
tortures inflicted by the former.</p>

<p>The circumstance of the introduction of bloodhounds
I have heard spoken of by some who were
engaged in the war, and they have all declared that
many of the statements of the cruelties said to have
been committed by them were unfounded. They were
brought it is true, but the blacks were prepared for
them; and although in some instances in which they
were tried they tore some persons, and absolutely
devoured a child or two, yet they were found to be
ineffectual for the object for which they were intended,
as they were shot in great numbers, so that
at last they had but few to use, and those which were
left were rendered useless, from the negroes having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
been always prepared to meet them. I do not mean
by this that it at all lessened the enormity of such an
act, on the part of the French, because it was not
successful; on the contrary, the ferocity of it stands
unmitigated, although it proved abortive.</p>

<p>In the plains of the Cape, and in the city, the
massacres by the French were beyond the powers of
description; and the least that can be said of the
conduct of the agents of the French government is,
that they must have been bereft of all feelings of
humanity, that they were of the worst and most debased
of the dregs of the French people, and unworthy
to become the associates of even the untutored
savage. The latter may plead nature for his savage
propensities, but the former has nothing to offer to
lessen the magnitude of his crimes, or to efface the
recollection of his unheard-of cruelties.</p>

<p>Whilst these scenes of carnage and destruction
were at their height, the French were daily losing
their positions, and their force was constantly diminishing
from the effects of the pestilence which raged
through the whole army. The general-in-chief, who
had for some time been in an impaired state of
health, began visibly to sink under the ravages of
disease, and on the 1st of November he breathed
his last, leaving in the memory of his opponents a
name blackened by the worst of crimes, unatoned for
by one single virtue.</p>

<p>The command of the army now devolved on General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Rochambeau, who, to say the least of him, was
a worthy successor of Le Clerc, and possessed similar
<i>virtues</i>. To him, therefore, was it left to pursue
that barbarous policy which had been introduced by
his predecessor, and which only tended to inflame
the ardour of the black troops, without in any way
promoting the good of the French cause. Rochambeau
certainly took the command at a time when it
must have appeared that the object of the expedition
had failed, and that the prolongation of the contest
would be attended with no favourable result. Opposed
to an enemy, whose force was daily increasing,
and whose ardour was unabated and resolution unshaken,
he had but little hopes of accomplishing
any thing beyond acting on the defensive, until such
reinforcements should arrive as would enable him to
act on the offensive with some degree of effect; but,
even then, there seemed not the remotest possibility
of his being able to retrieve the positions which had
been lost, and place his forces in such security as
might enable him to provide for a retreat, should
subsequent disasters make such an alternative absolutely
necessary.</p>

<p>In the early part of 1803, nothing decisive was
done on either side. Rochambeau and Dessalines
came in contact, and a battle ensued, in which the
latter was successful; but the scene of carnage and
massacres which followed is much too painful to
admit of being detailed. The French general, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
took about five hundred prisoners, put them all to
death, forgetting or careless of the fate of his own
soldiers who were in the power of his enemy. The
latter retaliated; and the next morning at day break,
on as many gibbets, there were exhibited five hundred
French officers and men, sacrificed through the
savage impetuosity of their general.</p>

<p>The war having broken out between England and
France in July, a British squadron appeared off
Cape François and blockaded the harbour, thereby
rendering to the blacks a most important service,
which in a great measure contributed to accelerate
the expulsion of the French. This squadron precluded
the possibility of the French receiving any
supplies from the Spanish port, and the garrison and
inhabitants of the city were therefore reduced to the
most lamentable extremities. Every thing that could
be found, horses, mules, asses, all had been consumed,
and they were at last obliged to feed upon
dogs. It is said “that the French were obliged for
several weeks to subsist on those very bloodhounds,
which they had procured for the purpose of hunting
down the negroes.”</p>

<p>The city was at last reduced to the most melancholy
state from the effects of famine and disease,
the besiegers making great exertions to intercept any
supplies that might be on their way for the relief of
the besieged. All hopes of eluding the vigilance of
his enemies having at length vanished, and extensive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
preparations having been made to take the city
by storm, the French commander-in-chief began to
see that there would be a necessity for offering to
capitulate. Dessalines having received these proposals,
agreed to them, and the articles were signed
on the 19th of November. These articles were certainly
highly favourable to the French, for they
provided for the security of private property, and
that all their sick and wounded should be carefully
attended by the blacks, and afterwards conveyed to
France in vessels bearing a neutral flag. For the
evacuation ten days were allowed, and Rochambeau
attempted a ruse de guerre, by which he hoped to
evade the English squadron then blockading the
city, but in this he totally failed. He thought that
the strong and stormy winds which prevailed during
the autumnal months, might blow off the English
ships, and enable the French squadron to steal away
unperceived; but the English commodore saw the
design of the French general, and consequently increased
his vigilance, and began to provide against
the attempt meditated by the French commander.</p>

<p>Finding that he had been too sanguine, and that
it was not possible to elude the vigilance of the
English squadron, Rochambeau was obliged to enter
into terms with the British commodore, to avoid
the dreadful alternative of destruction in the harbour
by red-hot shot, with which he was threatened,
from the time agreed upon in the articles having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
expired. The force which surrendered consisted of
three frigates and nearly twenty smaller vessels,
and prisoners to the number of about eight thousand
men were taken first to Jamaica and afterwards
to England.</p>

<p>Thus ended the war between the French and the
blacks in St. Domingo, and thus an expedition,
which at different periods brought out upwards of
forty thousand men, terminated in discomfiture and
disgrace; and which, from the conduct of the respective
generals on whom the command devolved,
will ever remain an indelible stain on the military
character of their country. No expedition in the
annals of that country had been fitted out under
more favourable and encouraging auspices, and
respecting the success of which a greater interest
was excited. Composed of the finest troops, and
under the most experienced officers, a different
termination might have been anticipated; but a
mistaken policy having been pursued, after the
moment of victory, the advantages which had been
previously gained were altogether lost, and upon
the victors was entailed the odium of defeat, together
with the reproach of neglect, and the want of
precaution and discernment.</p>

<p>The end of December, 1803, therefore beheld
the blacks in quiet possession of the island, after a
struggle in which they certainly exhibited proofs of
skill and perseverance in the multifarious duties of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
the field, highly creditable to their chiefs who had
the planning of them, and to the inferior leaders on
whom devolved the executive part: and it would
be wrong not to express in proper terms, the admiration
called forth by the resistance which they
made whenever they were hard pressed by the
French troops. They at times displayed a great
deal of heroism and unshaken courage. Standing
on the dead bodies of their comrades, they were
often seen fighting man to man with the French.
Such real determination to protect their liberty was
never contemplated by the French; the colonists,
who had been the promoters of the expedition,
always represented the negro character as being
completely deficient in courage, and destitute of
every necessary ingredient for making soldiers. In
part this may be true, but examples of individual
bravery among the negro population were not wanting
to negative the first charge; and although the
last may be partially admitted, still time and experience
had made them efficient for the field, and
the sequel has sufficiently proved that, at the evacuation
of the island, the negro troops were in a
state of discipline but little inferior to the French,
and in point of courage equal. Looking at them
in other respects, and taking into consideration
that they were men, who before, nay even at that
time, were in the grossest state of ignorance and
moral degradation, our astonishment is excited,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
when we find that in the moment of rage and
revenge they often refrained from acts of cruelty
and torture, whilst their insatiable enemies were
committing the most shocking and unfeeling barbarities.</p>

<p>It is fairly to be presumed, that during the war
but little time could be devoted to the cultivation
of the soil, and that every thing relating to it must
have been neglected and have dwindled into a very
backward state, and that this was the case I believe
is generally known, for the cultivators were obliged
to fly to arms, and were scarcely ever permitted
during the struggles to return to their homes; the
only persons, therefore, who could employ themselves
on their plantations were the females, and
such of their children as were too young to carry
arms. But the efforts of these were not of much
use, for such was the destruction which accompanied
the movements of the parties at war, that the
estates were laid waste on each side of the line of
march for some miles. Every operation of agriculture
was therefore in a very languid state, and
the apprehension under which people laboured was
so great that they thought not of any productions
beyond what they required for their own sustenance:
having no inducement to look forward, they only
guarded against present wants.</p>

<p>It is represented by many intelligent persons
amongst the people of colour, and in particular by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
the late Baron D&mdash;&mdash;, who was secretary to Christophe,
and a man of considerable talent and of
the most unquestionable veracity, that the successors
of Toussaint had not that influence over the
cultivators which their predecessor had, and that
neither persuasion nor the expectation of gain could
prevail upon them to return to their agricultural
employment: and that immediately after the war, it
would have been impolitic, if not utterly impracticable,
to have enforced it, as any thing like coercion
at that moment, when the minds of the people were
in a ferment, might have been attended with the
most disastrous consequences.</p>

<p>Commerce too had also been suspended for the
want of articles of exchange for the manufactures
of Europe and the provisions of America, and
during the existence of the struggle foreigners were
deterred from adventuring to any extent, fearing
the consequences resulting from such an unsettled
state of things.</p>

<p>Toussaint certainly made great efforts to revive
commerce as well as agriculture, and until he was
treacherously seized by the French, he certainly
promoted both to an extent which, when the state
of the country and the agitation of the people
are weighed, appears somewhat surprising, and of
which I shall hereafter give a specification. The
system adopted by Toussaint was not dissimilar to
that which appears to prevail in Russia, where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
peasantry are attached to the soil, “adscripti
glebæ”; and he acted wisely by doing so on account
of his people, of whose innate love of indolence he
was no mean judge, and he was anxious to remove
it, to promote industry and stimulate exertion.</p>

<p>The population of St. Domingo at this period
had greatly diminished; the natural increase had
been very small, and the ravages of war had caused
the loss of a great many, besides the emigration
which had taken place under the protection of the
French. The entire population in 1802, as estimated
by M. Rumboldt, was three hundred and
seventy-five thousand; of which two hundred and
ninety thousand were cultivators, forty-seven thousand
seven hundred domestics, sailors, &amp;c. and thirty-seven
thousand three hundred soldiers. By a subsequent
statement of the population of the island in
the year 1803, immediately after the expulsion of the
French, and of which a note was given to me by an
individual who was about the person of Dessalines
at the time of his accession to the chief command,
the number appears to have been about three hundred
and forty-eight thousand, of which two hundred
and seventy-two thousand were cultivators,
thirty-five thousand soldiers, and the remainder
were composed of domestics, artisans, and a few
sailors. The difference between these two statements
of twenty-seven thousand in so short a time
appears large, but the destruction of men must have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
been very great indeed during that period, from the
extraordinary rancour which existed in the French,
and from their cruel determination to give no
quarter, but to pursue a system of extermination
until they had completely destroyed all those who
were inimical to their interest. The emigration to
the Spanish part of the island was also considerable;
many fled thither to avert the impending blow, and
to save themselves from the fate which awaited those
who had been wavering in the cause of liberty.
The successors of Toussaint they were aware would
visit them with the heaviest penalties, and from
the known ferocity of Dessalines they had to expect
but little mercy, his character among his brethren
for barbarity and thirst for blood and revenge being
too well established not to be greatly dreaded.</p>

<p>I shall now proceed to take a short review of the
proceedings of the succeeding chiefs who governed
the island after this time. In doing so, I shall abstain
from any reference to military operations, except
in cases where it may be required for the
clearer illustration of my subject.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p class="pch">Independence declared.&mdash;Dessalines attempts to take the
city of Santo Domingo.&mdash;Raised to the imperial dignity.&mdash;New
constitution.&mdash;His atrocious massacres.&mdash;Attempts
to import negroes from Africa.&mdash;Encourages

death and character.</p>

<p class="pn2"><span class="smcap">The</span> independence of Hayti was declared on the
1st of January, 1804, and the first step taken by
Dessalines, who had been vested with the chief command,
was to endeavour to stop the emigration
which was going on, and remove the delusion under
which the blacks were labouring. For this purpose
he caused it to be made generally known, that all
previous opinions would be buried in oblivion,
and those who had been allured to take part with
the enemies of the colony, and had been induced
to emigrate from apprehension of the consequences
which such conduct might entail upon them, were
invited to return to their homes, being assured of
protection and security; at the same time, however,
he gave it out, that all those who were disposed to
accompany the French army were at liberty to do
so, and should be allowed to depart unmolested.
This augured favourably, and many took advantage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
of this declaration of clemency, who afterwards had
to regret their credulity and condemn their own
want of foresight and discretion.</p>

<p>To give a colour of clemency and humanity to this
declaration of the black general-in-chief, and to
stamp it with the mark of sincerity, another proclamation
was issued signed by Dessalines, Christophe,
and Clerveaux, a mulatto, in which the independence
of the colony is declared, and encouragement
given to the emigrants to return to
their properties. It says, “towards those men who
do us justice, we will act as brothers; let them rely for
ever on our esteem and friendship; let them return
amongst us. The God who protects us, the God
of freemen, bids us stretch out towards them our
conquering arms.” Allured by a proclamation
which held out a promise of security and protection,
many returned from the interior of the island,
whither they had fled for safety.</p>

<p>As a great many freemen of colour, as well as
slaves, had emigrated to the United States at the
commencement of the revolution, and as many had
manifested a desire to return, but were without the
means of accomplishing it, Dessalines devised a
plan to enable them to do so; but this plan does
not appear to have succeeded, for there is no authentic
proof that any of them ever returned: it is
on the contrary known, that although the emissaries of
Dessalines were industriously employed in America,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
but very few of the negroes and people of colour
availed themselves of the advantages which were so
glowingly held out to them; doubting the sincerity
of the general-in-chief on the one hand, and on the
other, living in some degree of comfort and tranquillity
with their new masters, they had no wish to
try an experiment by which they might lose a great
deal, and gain nothing. As it afterwards turned out,
their decision was prudent and wise, for it was no
doubt the aim of the inhuman Dessalines to make
them all objects of his brutal ferocity, and this was
the impression of those who were beyond the reach
of his vengeance; they could never be inspired
with the hope of safety, were they to give up the
hold of which they had obtained possession. To
hazard a security, by visionary schemes of improvement
is a proof of weakness and indiscretion; and
those who had obtained that security were determined
to preserve it, by not listening to the proposals
of the negro chief. Had such a proposal
been made by Toussaint, many, from an innate love
of their native soil, would no doubt have accepted
it; but a proposition from a man so base and sanguinary
as Dessalines, surely, could never have
found one individual who would have had faith or
confidence in it. It is evident, that he meditated
the destruction of all those who returned, and that
too in the most cruel and brutal way; such a thing
as mercy formed no constituent of the character of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
the most ferocious tyrant that ever afflicted the inhabitants
of any country. Those who had emigrated
to America, I think, would have returned, had the
proposition for their doing so been made by any
other of the chiefs; but coming from such a wretch
as Dessalines, it deterred instead of having encouraged
them.</p>

<p>A short time after Dessalines had been invested
with the chief command, he began to discard all
the appellations which were used in the time of the
French, and Hayti, the name given to the island
by the Aborigines, was adopted instead of Saint
Domingo, and he was severe in the extreme towards
any one who might by the smallest and purest accident
use any of the abrogated terms. This was
followed by a general call on the people to revenge
the wrongs which they had endured, and to execute
vengeance upon those whom they conceived to
have been the authors of it. The white French
people, therefore, were indiscriminately sacrificed,
not indeed by the inhabitants or cultivators, who
preferred peace, and wished clemency to be shewn towards
all, but by the troops, headed by their officers,
and under the orders of the general-in-chief. No
age nor sex was spared: the brutal soldiers, led on
by their merciless officers, ran from door to door,
and left not one alive whom they could find within;
the females, whose amiable softness might have
stayed the hand of the savage in his native wilds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
first endured the most dreadful violation, and then
were bayoneted and most shockingly mangled.</p>

<p>Military execution is at all times, and in all countries,
to be greatly dreaded. It is always attended
with those appalling enormities and barbarities,
which make it the scourge of those nations which
resort to it; it shews not the least mercy to either
the innocent, the child, or the female with all her
sweetness and charms, but all are indiscriminately
the objects of its ravages, and the innocent with the
guilty feel its atrocious influence, without being able
to avert its vengeance and fury. In Hayti the effects
of it must have been heavy indeed, and from
the fact of its having been perpetrated by people
who were little advanced over the unlettered savage
of the desert, its consequences must have been horrible
beyond the powers of language to describe.
The measures which the merciless Dessalines adopted
were enough to deter people from expressing their
abhorrence for such vindictive proceedings. He
made all his officers assume the capacity of spies,
and in consequence, it became dangerous even to
speak; all therefore being silent spectators of his
enormities, he took it for granted that they approved,
whilst fear alone prevented them from loudly
pronouncing their abhorrence and detestation of his
most flagitious conduct.</p>

<p>This crafty and execrable monster had recourse
to one of the most diabolical acts recorded in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
annals of history, for the purpose of collecting all
those people together, who had escaped from the
military massacres. He gave it out by a proclamation,
that as he intended to stay his vengeance for
the sufferings to which his brethren had been exposed,
all those who had escaped execution under
his military decree, should appear at an appointed
spot for the purpose of receiving tickets, which
might in future protect them from the vengeance of
the people; and many who had been fortunate
enough to escape, as they thought, in the first
massacre, became the victims of the second; for no
sooner did these unsuspecting and deluded creatures
obtain what they conceived an assurance that their
lives would be spared, than leaving their hiding
places, they ran with eagerness to the place announced
for issuing the tickets, when they were
immediately seized and led away for instant execution.
Before he perpetrated so deliberate, base,
cool blooded, and horrible an act, even Nero would
have paused; but the infamous and blood thirsty
negro Dessalines secretly rejoiced at the success of
his inhuman stratagem.</p>

<p>Another of this monster’s acts of barbarity is recorded.
A young Frenchman, the son of a very opulent
planter, had escaped during the early part of the
revolution, with his father and the rest of his family,
to Jamaica, where he had followed the occupation of
a clerk in a mercantile house in Kingston. On its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
being known that all persons were invited back to
their native country, he adopted the resolution to
go up to Port au Prince, and procure leave to settle
there. Speaking English fluently, he obtained a clerkship
in the counting-house of an English merchant
in that city. After having been there for some time,
the monster heard of him, and it was intimated that
he was a Frenchman. When he was sent for to appear
at the government-house, the young man complied,
and attended at the time appointed. Dessalines
received him in the presence of his numerous
officers, and told him that he had sent for him to
ascertain if he were a Frenchman. The young man
replied in the negative, and that he was a native of
Jamaica, born of French parents, and had come to
the city as a clerk to an establishment connected
with the house in which he had lived in that
island. Dessalines expressed much regret at the disappointment
he felt, said he hoped to discover in
him the son of a planter of his name, from whom
he, Dessalines, had received much kindness, and
who had once saved his life; and stated that he was
most anxious to learn if any of the family were
living, that he might be enabled to shew his gratitude,
by restoring them to their estates, and affording
them encouragement and protection. The
young man elated with this expression of kindness
and good will, and in the moment of credulous joy,
declared himself to be the son of the man whom he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
had represented as having been his benefactor. The
inhuman savage with a laugh which resounded
through the whole apartment, and jumping, as he
was wont to do whenever he had succeeded in entrapping
an individual, from his chair, ordered the
young man to be bayoneted in his presence, which
was instantly done, whilst he looked on with the
most ferocious countenance, indicative of the inward
satisfaction he felt in having sacrificed another
victim on the altar of revenge.</p>

<p>It is certain that Dessalines willingly took upon
himself the responsibility of all these enormities;
he even gloried in them, boasted that he had inflicted
them on the French, and alleged that his
predecessor Toussaint had been too lenient and too
backward in his measures against those who opposed
his cause. In his subsequent proclamation, he
claims to himself the whole merit of these atrocious
proceedings, and declares that in future he will
admit no Europeans to hold property in the colony.
That part of his proclamation is extremely harsh,
and shews the malignancy of his nature, and his
hatred of the whites; it states, as the translation
from another author has it: “Generals, officers,
soldiers, somewhat unlike him who has preceded me,
the ex-general Toussaint L’Ouverture, I have been
faithful to the promise I have made to you when
I took up arms against tyranny, and whilst a spark
of life remains in me I will keep my oath. Never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
again shall a colonist or European set his foot upon
this territory, with the title of master or proprietor.
This resolution shall henceforward form the fundamental
basis of our constitution.”<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>When all the massacres were at an end, he began
to turn his attention towards restoring the country
to some degree of tranquillity, after the injuries
which it had sustained by the war, and to endeavour,
if possible, to remove the fears under which the people
seemed to labour, from the apprehension of a
future interruption of their quiet and repose. He
therefore determined to visit all parts under his
command, and to make those arrangements which
had a tendency, not only to augment the wealth of
the island, but also to promote the welfare of his
people, and inspire confidence in his future government.
So commendable an act was certainly entitled
to the highest praise and consideration, but
emanating from so execrable a character it seemed
paradoxical, and many questioned his sincerity, and
were apprehensive that he contemplated measures
of a contrary tendency. In the present instance,
however, he was not dissembling, for he evinced
more than common anxiety for the reestablishment
of agriculture, and held out to the people the high
advantages that were to be derived from their personal
exertions in the culture of their lands; and
for the purpose of stimulating them, he assured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
them of his intention to encourage an intercourse
with the United States and England, in order to
open a vent for their own productions, and to ensure
on better terms the purchase of those articles of
foreign growth and manufacture of which they stood
in need. This seems to have been particularly offered
for his consideration by some American merchants
of respectability, with whom Dessalines frequently
held conferences on subjects having a reference
to his future government: and it has been
communicated to me by one of them, that he was,
notwithstanding his irascible temper, very attentive
to their representations, and shewed great deference
for their opinions, and frequently acted upon them
in matters of commerce, when he found them consistent
with the policy which he meant to pursue;
otherwise he heard them deliberate upon them, and
if he thought they proposed any thing to which he
could not readily concur, he would freely state his
objections, but always expressed himself thankful.</p>

<p>After a short period had elapsed, he also
began to concert measures for the reduction of the
Spanish part of the island. The city of Santo
Domingo had rendered ineffectual all the efforts of
the blacks to sow dissensions among the people.
There were but few slaves in this part of the island,
and those were living in so great a state of equality
with the people, that slavery was only known by
name, and they evinced no desire whatever to throw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
off their adherence to their masters, and join their
brethren of the west. Both these parties united in
their resolution to oppose the tyrant, whom they
equally detested, should he appear before Santo
Domingo. At last Dessalines laid siege to the city,
vainly conceiving that the terror of his name and
the extent of his achievements would deter the people
from making any resistance, and that they would
surrender on his first appearance before it, on being
assured of his protection and friendship. But in this
he was egregiously deceived, for the besieged made
strong preparations for defence, and determined on
the most vigorous efforts to repel his attacks. In
the mean time a reinforcement having arrived from
France, proved a very seasonable succour to the inhabitants;
this induced Dessalines to raise the siege
and return to the west, without having been able to
carry into effect this last design, which caused him
no little chagrin and disappointment.</p>

<p>His tour through the country, and his incursion
to the Spanish part of the island, were followed in
a short time by his elevation to the imperial dignity;
on the 8th of October, 1804, with great parade and
splendour, he was crowned “Emperor of Hayti.”
His elevation to the imperial throne was recognized
in the following year by the new constitution,
and being proclaimed immediately throughout the
island, the announcement was received with little or
no enthusiasm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>In this new constitution there are some things
which certainly indicate a great desire for the improvement
of the country, and manifest a very
strong wish to promote the happiness and improve
the condition of the people, and to introduce something
like morality among them. It says, that no
Haytian is entitled to the privileges of a citizen,
who does not inherit all the qualities of a good
father, a good son, and a good husband. No child
could be disinherited by his parents; emigration
subjected a person to the loss of his citizenship, and
a citizen becoming bankrupt lost all his privileges;
all citizens too were required to make themselves
skilful in some mechanical trade. Such enactments
as these did credit to the people from whom they
emanated, and must in some measure soften our
detestation of Dessalines, who consented that they
should form a part of the fundamental laws which
he was sworn to observe, and by which he engaged
to govern. By the new constitution also religion
was tolerated, although it was declared that there
should be no predominant religion, copying in this
particular the United States, which it was the aim
of the Haytians to imitate as nearly as circumstances
would permit. Marriage it declared to be merely a
civil ceremony, tending to improve society, and to
inspire the people with a disgust for the unlimited
sensuality then so prevalent in the country.</p>

<p>Dessalines during his imperial reign made the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
strongest efforts to increase the population of the
island, his ferocious disposition having been somewhat
softened by the sweets of peace and tranquillity,
which now in all parts happily reigned. People
of colour and blacks began to return to their homes,
and others from the French and British colonies
found their way thither, and were received in a very
cordial manner, every pledge of protection being
given them. One act of the emperor, however, for
the purpose of increasing his male population, seems
to have excited no little astonishment as well as indignation,
and that was the importation of people
from Africa. For this object he wished to enter into
a commercial treaty with the British agent from
Jamaica, offering to open the ports of Hayti to the
British slave ships, and to grant to the Jamaica importers
the exclusive right of selling negroes in
Hayti! True it is, the privilege was to extend to
the importation of men only, and that they were
not to be sold to any other persons but those appointed
by the government, which wanted them, as
it has been generally wished should be understood,
to increase their military establishment, but which
in fact required them for the cultivation of the government
lands which had fallen into a state of
neglect and unproductiveness. This arrangement
however did not take place; not by reason of any
backwardness evinced by the emperor, but because
no disposition was shewn by the British agent to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
accept the offer of a grant, which, to say the least
of it, appeared a most extraordinary and unaccountable
measure. Some have observed, that the
emperor himself was dissuaded from it on the ground
that its principle was nearly allied to that slave
trade, to which it could not fail to give encouragement;
but he contended, that it was a measure of
necessity, of political expediency, which, with him,
superseded every other consideration; and besides,
he alleged that he should be performing an act of
humanity towards the African race, by permitting
them to be brought into his dominions, as otherwise
they would be taken to Jamaica and made slaves.</p>

<p>From a note which I obtained of a census taken
in 1805, the population of Hayti appears to have
amounted to about four hundred thousand, of all denominations,
so that by natural augmentation and
by emigration from other countries, there was an
evident increase in three years of at least twenty-five
thousand, taking M. Humboldt’s statement of
the population in 1802 to be a correct one. But
from the manner in which the census was taken, a
considerable degree of inaccuracy must have arisen,
and hence the census of 1805 may in all probability
have overstated the actual number: otherwise the
increase seems to have been prodigious, and consequently
questionable. The taking of a census was
left entirely to the military officers of the respective
districts in which they commanded, and a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
large proportion of these personages could neither
read nor write, and no great confidence can therefore
be placed in these returns.</p>

<p>Placide Justin states the amount of the census of
1805 at three hundred and eighty thousand, and
twenty thousand, which from a variety of causes,
he says, may have been omitted in the returns.
This is a strong evidence of their mode of taking
a census being most imperfect.</p>

<p>Dessalines was particularly solicitous for the
encouragement of the cultivators of the soil, and
held out to them every possible inducement to
labour. The code of Toussaint was enforced, and
the people seemed to work contentedly, but not to
the same extent as they did in Toussaint’s time.
By Dessalines the cultivators were permitted to
change the estates on which they had chosen to
work, on expressing to the commanding officer of
the district that they wished to do so, and by assigning
a sufficient reason for such wish: but on no
other account could they leave the property without
incurring the penalty attached to such an offence.
Now whatever may be said about the freedom of the
cultivators by the advocates for free labour, I
must be permitted to say, that no instance has yet
been adduced of such freedom in practice, and I
must beg leave to maintain still that the code of
Toussaint, which was acted upon by his successor,
exhibits a greater proof of the existence of coercion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
than any thing I have seen, and that the conduct
pursued by Dessalines towards the cultivators,
though he wished it to be understood that he was
anxious for their welfare, was harsh and severe in
the extreme, and that those who worked on the
government estates felt it so. It has been communicated
to me by an individual who managed one
of the properties held by the government, that
Dessalines, who well knew the work which could
be performed by one man, had a regular daily return
sent in to him of the quantum of work done, and
should there have been any relaxation from the day
before, he broke out into a torrent of abuse, and
often sentenced the negligent negroes, as a punishment,
to labour on the public roads.</p>

<p>The greater portion of the labour bestowed upon
the soil was confined to the cultivation of coffee.
The sugar plantations having been destroyed and the
works demolished, but little sugar was now made in
proportion to the quantity produced in the time of
the French, as will be shewn hereafter in my general
remarks upon the agricultural state of the
country, and the specifications of the returns at
the respective periods.</p>

<p>Dessalines, it is said, paid some attention to the
clergy, although he was but little better than an
infidel. He gave strict injunctions that all persons
should be attentive to the celebration of public
worship, and particularly observe the sabbath.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
This was a measure dictated by policy, for the better
preserving order, and keeping the people in a
tranquil state. He went through the exterior
forms of religious worship as a matter of necessity,
and as an example to his subjects, but not from
any inward feelings of devotion or regard for
religion. He encouraged marriage as much as
possible among his people, and rigidly exacted attention
to it, and endeavoured to impress his
people with the impropriety of sensuality and
voluptuousness; but in his own person he appears to
have been the most depraved and most licentious
man in the country.</p>

<p>The army of the emperor did not form a very
powerful body. His standing force after the conclusion
of the war did not exceed twenty thousand
men, of infantry and cavalry. The militia, or, as
they were formerly termed, the national guards,
were numerous, because every man from the age of
sixteen to fifty was obliged to assemble four times a
year, and undergo a regular service of training for
several days at each period, when they returned to
their usual avocations. His troops were active, well
disciplined and armed, but their clothing was of
the coarsest kind, and at all times in the very worst
condition. All the fortifications in the different
parts of the island he endeavoured to put in a proper
state of defence, lest the French should make
another descent, of which they were at times very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
apprehensive, and he took care to keep all the provision
grounds in the vicinity of the several fastnesses
in the mountains in a good state, that the
different garrisons might be well supplied with provisions
in case it should, at any subsequent period,
become necessary to resort to them for security.
The good old maxim, that the best security for the
preservation of peace is always to be prepared for
war, seems not to have been forgotten by Dessalines,
or by those on whom the executive part of
his government devolved.</p>

<p>Although Dessalines, impressed at last by a sense
of his own enormities, endeavoured to make some
atonement for them, yet the people, who had so
often experienced the severity of his mandates, and
dreaded a recurrence of similar measures, secretly
detested him as a savage and a tyrant, under whom
it was not possible to expect happiness or repose;
and any indication of mildness and humanity was
only considered the forerunner of some atrocious
crime which he meditated. Wearied out by his
suspicions and jealousies, deprived of friends and
connexions who were often snatched from them, and
hurried to an immediate execution, without even
the semblance of judicial proceedings having been
instituted against them, the people at last determined
to dethrone him, and aided by his troops,
who could no longer submit to his caprices and his
tyranny, they conspired against him, and in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
vicinity of Port au Prince, and at no great distance
from the north gate of the city, he was killed by
one of his own soldiers, on the 17th of October,
1806.</p>

<p>The individual who shot him was a mulatto
youth, whom I have seen, and who at the time of
the tyrant’s death did not exceed fifteen years of
age. He was attached to the militia, and was in
ambush at the time of Dessalines’ advance at the
head of his staff, accompanied by some soldiers.
The moment they saw their master fall, some of
them attempted to revenge his death, but they met
a similar fate: others rejoiced at an event which
appeared to them merely in the light of just retribution
for crimes of unparalleled inhumanity and
atrocity.</p>

<p>Dessalines had been a slave; his master was a
carpenter, or shingler, somewhat like a tiler in
England. He was short, but very stoutly formed,
and capable of undergoing more than the ordinary
fatigue of men. His capacity was not extensive,
rising but little, if at all, above mediocrity; he could
neither read nor write, with the exception of being
capable of signing his name. His military talents
had more the appearance of daring movements,
than of judicious and well planned operations; and
he more often succeeded by his own courage and
example, than by the superiority of his arrangements.
His activity was surprising, and the celerity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
with which he moved from one point of his
command to another, astonished even his enemies.
He was vain, capricious, and fond of flattery;
and those who were most forward to compliment
him for his exterior embellishments, to which he
was exceedingly attentive, were certain of being
admitted into his favour. His last wife, for he had
been twice married, is now living in Port au Prince
in retirement, and with a very small income. She
is quite neglected by the present government, to its
disgrace, as she had often been the means of staying
the bloody hand of her husband, when he was about
to sign an order for the indiscriminate execution of
the whites and mulattoes. She bears the marks of
a negress who at one time was extremely handsome,
and her exterior must have been commanding: she
is rather above the middle size of females, but not
too tall, nor yet too large in proportion. The white
inhabitants of Port au Prince, and particularly
strangers who occasionally visit it, never fail to attempt
to obtain a sight of her, as her name and
her character excite a great deal of interest, and
surely entitle her to the best support of the existing
government, which boasts&mdash;and it is only an empty
boast&mdash;of being generous to those who have rendered
the country a service.</p>

<p class="pn2"><span class="smcap">When</span> Dessalines fell, the people seemed to consider
that they were released from the most abject
and oppressive tyranny, and the event was celebrated
with the greatest demonstrations of joy; and satisfaction
and comfort were observed in the countenances
of the people, whilst the soldiers congratulated
each other on being relieved from a state of servitude
almost insupportable. It was no doubt a most
fortunate event for the liberty of the people, and
their exultations therefore cannot be in the least a
matter of astonishment.</p>

<p>There was one evil however which they had not
to contend with in the time of Dessalines, a competition
for the chief command. He had kept all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
in subordination by the terror of his name, none
daring to oppose him; and consequently, so long as
the people attended to the duties of their station,
and remained passive observers of the measures of
his government, they were not molested; but after
his death, civil war was rekindled, and their repose
much disturbed, and consequently their avocations
for a time were again partially suspended.</p>

<p>Christophe, who had been next in command to
Dessalines, and who, during the period of Toussaint’s
sway, displayed great skill and activity at
the head of the troops under his command, and to
whom was entrusted the defence of the city of Cape
François, on the arrival of the French army under
Le Clerc, now assumed the supreme command in
Hayti, and from his spirit and talent he seemed
better qualified for this important trust than any
other of the officers attached to the government.
At this period he stood very high in the estimation
of the people, and his humanity, with his moral
and religious conduct, had diffused a general satisfaction
and approval of his elevation. His bravery
was indisputable, as he had upon several trying
occasions manifested a degree of courage, which
inspired his troops with confidence and his country
with admiration. His assumption of the supreme
command was therefore pleasing to his countrymen,
who were not backward in proving that his elevation
met with their universal concurrence, and that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
looked forward for the most flourishing and happy
times from an event so auspicious.</p>

<p>Christophe displayed great judgment and good
sense at the very beginning of his government by
calling around him men of talent, both black and
coloured, whether they had been at all times attached
to the cause of independence, or, on the contrary,
had on some occasions been ranged in opposition
to it. He made no distinction; he looked for
men of abilities wherever they could be found, and
he had no aversion for even the whites (unless they
were French, of whom he was always suspicious
from their intriguing characters), having several of
them near him, with whom he would often consult
on matters of state policy, and on his future views
with regard to agriculture, commerce, and matters
of finance. To these persons he always paid implicit
attention, deliberated upon every subject which they
thought it prudent to suggest, and otherwise evinced
a confidence in them, which in return inspired respect
for his authority and an attachment for his person.
With one of his secretaries, Mons. Dupuy,
afterwards Baron Dupuy, I have had some conversation
on subjects connected with the history of his
country. He was a man of education and of great
natural talents; had acquired considerable information
on matters of government, and seemed to possess
no little degree of knowledge of the politics and
views of the European cabinets. His mind was well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
stored with historical information, and he was sensible
of the way by which his country was to exalt
herself in the estimation of the world. He looked
upon it to be the first duty of the executive to devise
plans for the encouragement of agriculture, and for
the extension of commerce; and he left no means
untried to endeavour to open an intercourse with
those countries from which there was a probability
of deriving advantages, and with England in particular,
which he highly extolled. To Mons. Dupuy,
Christophe looked up with attention; and although
he was a man of colour, which, as some have insinuated,
was objectionable, not one in his suite received
more attention, for there was not one who
could be more serviceable: as the chief’s interpreter
too he was invaluable, and no man could have been
more faithful towards his master.</p>

<p>De Vastey, another of his secretaries, was also a
man of strong natural understanding, and a work
described as his “Reflections on the Blacks and
Whites”, with his notes, printed at Cape Haytian,
1814, shews, that he possessed no little acquaintance
with history, and that he was not without some
knowledge of mankind in most countries, as well as
of the opinions entertained in Europe on the affairs
of his country. De Vastey is now living at the Cape
in retirement, and is exceedingly attentive to the
English residents, for whom he has a very high respect
and veneration. He is a black.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>Mons. Prevost, afterwards Count Limonade, and
secretary for foreign affairs, exhibited proofs of a
very strong mind, and displayed considerable
knowledge in political matters, as his state papers
particularly exemplify: in him also Christophe
placed great confidence, and to him he entrusted the
entire regulation of his foreign communications; and
in doing so, he shewed that he confided in a servant
of no ordinary judgment and discretion, who seemed
to be impressed with a sense of the importance of his
duties, and shewed a great desire to acquit himself
to the satisfaction of his chief, and to ensure the respect
of his countrymen.</p>

<p>With such men as these, and one or two others,
English and Americans, Christophe generally conferred,
and to their suggestions for his future plans
of governing, he generally, if not always, acceded:
and it is not a matter therefore of any surprise if
the regulations with which he commenced his career
should be marked by great judgment, discretion,
and good policy.</p>

<p>The first step of Christophe was to assume the
plain and simple designation of “Chief of the Government
of Hayti”, under which, and not the imperial
dignity, it was his determination to govern; and he
made the most prompt arrangements for immediately
endeavouring to establish a commercial understanding
with Great Britain and the United
States. To effect this object he expressed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
greatest anxiety to several of the officers of the
British men-of-war who frequented the port of the
Cape, and to whom he always shewed the greatest
courtesy and civility. To the Americans who were
about him, and who had taken up their residence at
the Cape for the purpose of carrying on their commercial
dealings with the people, he also expressed
a similar desire; and the latter, always on the alert
to communicate any thing likely to extend the commercial
intercourse of their country, immediately
undertook to transmit his wish to their government,
but the proposition made to the British did not at
that time receive an immediate acquiescence. Had
it been consistent with the British colonial interests
to enter into a commercial treaty at this time, there
is no doubt, I think, of one having been concluded,
which would have insured to Great Britain privileges
of trade that would not have been conceded to any
other country. Every man connected with the government,
and who had any weight with Christophe,
considered it of paramount consequence that
the countenance of England should be gained, if possible,
and that it was expedient that such advantages
should be offered as would induce that power
to enter into a commercial treaty with them, without
at all adverting to the effect it might produce
on other powers: but it does not appear that
such measures were ever adopted, and it is presumed,
that an intimation was given from an undoubted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
quarter, that no propositions could be received
by the British government at that juncture in
consequence of the effect it might produce in their
own colonies. The matter, therefore, remained in
suspense, and Christophe began to turn his attention
to other important measures for the aggrandizement
of his country.</p>

<p>His first address teemed with sentiments which
did honour to the feelings by which he was actuated.
It was dated the 24th of October, 1806, and set
forth the system which he intended to pursue with
respect to commerce. It proclaimed certain free
ports, and that the flag of all nations would be respected,
and property protected; that personal
security was pledged; and that the odious law,
passed by his predecessor Dessalines, which established
exclusive consignments in the citizens of the
country, was abrogated, and that every individual
should be privileged to place his property in the
hands of his own factor, who should have the full
protection of the government.</p>

<p>Such regulations were productive of the greatest
benefit to the country. Americans and Europeans
began to find their advantage in trading with Hayti;
and the manufactures of England, with the provisions
of the United States, began to flow into it
freely, and in quantities quite large enough for the
means of the people, in return for which they obtained
the staple products of the country, and on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
terms that enabled them to carry on a very beneficial
and lucrative trade. The people were not
disposed for any of the extravagantly rich manufactures
of Europe; they confined themselves entirely
to such as their means would permit them to
purchase, and in no case was a system of credit
resorted to; every thing was confined to barter with
foreigners, who certainly were not yet sufficiently
conscious of the rectitude and integrity of the people,
to adopt a measure which was likely to be attended
with so much danger of loss. Where,
therefore, there was no credit, there was but little
if any risk, and the commerce of Hayti was, in
consequence of such a system, of great advantage
to those who engaged in it, many of those who first
adventured thither realizing handsome fortunes.</p>

<p>Christophe had not long been at the head of the
government before a competitor for the supreme authority
started up in the person of Alexandre Petion,
a mulatto, who had succeeded to the command held
by Clerveaux, after the death of that general, and
was subsequently commander-in-chief at Port au
Prince. Petion was greatly respected by the people;
he was of a mild and attractive manner, and possessed
talents of a very superior order. He had
been educated in France, and served in the French
armies, in which he had acquired the rank of a field
officer. He was a skilful engineer, in which capacity,
it appears, he had rendered the most essential<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
services to Toussaint and Dessalines, from both
of whom he received the greatest marks of attention
and advancement in his military rank. He was induced
to aim at the sovereign authority at the instigation
of the population of the southern and western
districts, the largest proportion of which were
persons of colour; and the blacks in the same division
were much inclined to support his claims,
his general deportment and his known talents having
inspired them with confidence and esteem.</p>

<p>Both chiefs now began to have recourse to arms,
and Christophe, who had succeeded in many of the
rencontres which had taken place, secured the whole
of the north; but on his advancing to the south, and
making an attempt on Port au Prince, he failed,
returned to his seat of government at Cape François,
and began to shew a disposition towards peace and
the prosecution of those designs which he meditated
for insuring the tranquillity of his country, and promoting
the happiness of the people.</p>

<p>In the February following he published his new
constitution, in which the Catholic religion is declared
to be the religion of the state, and every
other religion is tolerated. For the better encouragement
of commerce and an intercourse with foreigners,
it is declared “that the government solemnly guarantees
the foreign merchants the security of their
persons and properties.”</p>

<p>He began also to make great advancement in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
instruction of youth, and contemplated the establishment
of public schools, so soon as the state of
the country should be sufficiently tranquillized to
enable him to carry his intentions into effect.</p>

<p>In a proclamation which he subsequently issued,
he dwells strongly on the subject of agriculture, and
expresses an anxiety, beyond his ordinary solicitude,
for the encouragement of that great source of national
wealth. He makes a most forcible and
powerful appeal to the people, exhorting them to
an unceasing application to the culture of the lands,
by the produce of which foreigners would be attracted
to their ports, to enter into an exchange for
the products of their own countries, as well as for
money, whereby their country would advance in
wealth, and themselves in happiness and prosperity.
Being uninformed as to the line of politics which
foreign countries might adopt towards them, he declared
it to be his wish to remain quiet until they
had made their decision, expressing a hope only
that it might be such as would be favourable to
their commerce, and tend to cement an intercourse
founded on a basis of reciprocity.</p>

<p>The declaration often made by Christophe, that
he never would permit an interference with the colonies
of any European state, was often questioned
and never believed to be sincere; but an event
occurred which at once proved his sincerity, and
called forth the approbation of the British government.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
Discovering that some individuals in the
southern parts of the island were intriguing with
those persons in the island of Jamaica who were
hostile to their government, he immediately arrested
them, and brought them to punishment for infringing
the declaration which he had so often made.
The British government viewed this act of Christophe
in a very favourable light; and in consequence
of his integrity, it permitted an intercourse with certain
ports in Hayti, by an order of council of February,
1807. This contributed greatly to increase
the commercial views of Christophe, and became of
considerable importance to the Haytians, as well as
beneficial to British merchants.</p>

<p>In the year 1811, Christophe was raised to the
throne, under the title of King Henry, an act
which seems to have had the approbation of the
majority, if not of the whole of his subjects who
were endowed with talents to discriminate. They
were of opinion that the conversion of the state into
a monarchy suited the exigences of the times, as
more likely to make them respected abroad, and
maintain their rights at home; putting it ever out
of their consideration that it was an act only of gratitude,
that they should manifest their sentiments of
attachment for one who had, through a long career
of war and desolation, rendered such important services
in the cause of liberty.</p>

<p>The act which raised him to the throne provided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
also for the establishment of the various offices of
state, and made other important arrangements for
the security of the crown, declared hereditary in the
family of Christophe, all of which met with a general
concurrence, and gave the fullest satisfaction to
the people.</p>

<p>I shall not pursue my narrative of the operations
of the respective chiefs who were now at the heads
of the governments of the north and the south, but
merely notice a few circumstances which appeared
most prominent in the proceedings of each.</p>

<p>About the period of the elevation of Christophe
to the throne of the northern part of Hayti, a cessation
of hostilities between him and his rival took
place, through, it is generally believed, the intercession
of the British government, who interposed to
stop the further effusion of blood between the two
chieftains, and if possible to reconcile them to the
government of their respective divisions, without encroaching
on each other, or without again exciting
that jealousy which had so long existed between
them. The application to the British government
to take upon itself directly the adjustment of their
differences, and to suggest a reconciliation on specific
terms, was entrusted to the charge of a British merchant
in the confidence of Petion, who, from his reverses,
seemed to court a peace with his rival. Lord
Castlereagh, the then secretary of state for foreign
affairs in England, it is believed, declined to interfere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
when applied to upon the subject, the nature of
the application being such as to preclude the British
cabinet taking any part in it. Petion solicited the
aid of England to preserve his dominions against
the encroachment of his rival, in return for which
he offered to place the trade of the British upon a
more favourable footing than that of any other nation:
motives however of a political urgency in the
then state of the colonies of Great Britain induced
his lordship to reject the proposition; but it is understood,
and I believe generally admitted, that
there was an indirect suggestion made to Christophe
to suspend hostilities, and which succeeded; for we
do not perceive that any acts of aggression were subsequently
committed by either chief. It is also true
that Petion lowered the imposts on British goods
imported into his country from 12 to 7 per cent.,
giving them a preference of 5 per cent. over those
of other neutral nations.</p>

<p>Hostilities having been suspended, both these
chiefs began to turn their attention towards the improvement
of their dominions, and to use every
possible effort for the encouragement of agriculture
and commerce; but they certainly pursued
quite opposite courses to attain their end; and in a
few years it was evident, that the one who adopted a
system of rigid enforcement raised his country into
affluence, whilst the other who submitted to the indolent
habits of his people, and was regardless of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
the consequences that would ensue from too great a
supineness and inactivity, sunk it into the lowest
state of poverty, and was necessitated to resort to
measures which finally proved its ruin. I shall offer
a few remarks on the respective characters of these
two individuals, by way of shewing their different
ideas of the people whom they governed, and of the
most effectual way of raising their country to wealth
and prosperity.</p>

<p>Christophe, there is no doubt, was the most conversant
with the real character and disposition of
his countrymen. He was sensibly impressed with
the idea, that to govern them, it would be requisite
and imperative to resort to strong and powerful
measures, and not to proceed by slow and easy degrees:
he knew that if he were once to relax in his
authority, and permit them to pursue their own
course, indolence would become so deeply rooted,
that to obtain any exertions from them hereafter,
would prove a most Herculean task, and in all probability
lay the foundation of much irritation, if not
of disturbance. He was persuaded therefore, that,
before it would be possible to raise his country in
wealth and in happiness, an implicit obedience to
such regulations as he should deem adviseable, must
be enforced; that if the people were left to their
own free agency, from their innate love of indolence,
nothing could be obtained from them: they would
wander about quite unconcerned for to-morrow, satisfied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
with that which the day had produced. He
knew that the negro race were prone to idleness and
addicted to lust and sensuality; that they were ignorant
of the duties of civilized life, and of the ties
which bound them together; and it was a matter of
the first importance for the consideration of those
who were to direct the affairs of state, to devise the
means by which they should be taught their duty to
their country; that idleness and concupiscence were
vices of the worst cast; and that unless an upright
and moral course were pursued, they could neither
expect improvement in their individual condition,
nor advance themselves in the opinions of mankind.
To accomplish these objects, he was fully aware, or,
at all events, his advisers had made him sensible of
it, would be a work of no ordinary difficulty, and that
unless obedience could be legally exacted, and the
people compelled to the performance of all civil obligations,
it would only be a waste of time to attempt
to rule, or to endeavour to place the government on
a solid and permanent foundation.</p>

<p>With such impressions as these, Christophe and
his council and advisers set about a work, which,
whatever may be said of them as legislators, exhibits
no little share of talent and judgment. His Code
Henry made its appearance in 1812; it is a digest
of the laws passed for the government of the kingdom,
and seems to have provided for every class of
offences. Some of its laws are new, and others are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
founded upon the laws of his predecessors, with such
judicious curtailments or additions as circumstances
seemed to require. Those of agriculture and commerce
are decidedly such as were in force in the time
of Toussaint and Dessalines; and as they were effectual,
and tended highly to augment those sources of
national wealth, it displayed great discernment and
discretion in Christophe to adopt them as part of his
code.</p>

<p>With this shield for the executive administration
of the government, Christophe began to exact a
due observance of all those measures likely to be
beneficial to his country. He enforced attention to
agriculture, encouraged commerce with foreigners,
whom he led to his ports by extensive purchases of
their commodities to supply the wants of his government,
and he made rapid strides towards the advancement
of education by establishing schools for
the instruction of youth, and by inviting men of
learning and talents from all countries, for the purpose
of presiding at the head of the institutions which
he had formed for the promotion of science. His
regulations unquestionably display sound views of
policy, which ought to have ensured the welfare of
the country, together with the security and happiness
of its people.</p>

<p>It has been often asserted that the negroes are as
capable of receiving instruction in morality, religion,
and every branch of science, as the people of any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
other nation or colour. This I shall not attempt to
deny; but it may not be improper to say that very
few instances have yet been adduced to support such
a theory, and that Hayti is an illustration of the
contrary being the fact; for with all the advantages,
with all the opportunities which Christophe afforded
his people to improve their minds, and to seek for
knowledge in the various branches of science, very
few indeed have been found who have raised themselves
above mediocrity, whilst thousands have been
found incapable of tuition, or have rejected instruction
altogether.</p>

<p>Mazeres, in speaking of them, says, “The negro
is only a grown child, shallow, light, fickle, thoughtless,
neither keenly sensible of joy or of sorrow, improvident,
without resources in his spirits or his soul.
Careless, like other sluggards; rest, singing, his
women, and his dress form the contracted limits of
his taste. I say nothing of his affections, for affections,
properly so called, are too strong for a soul so
soft, so inactive as his.”<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>On the subject of public instruction, which, the
same writer contends, can never be introduced into
Hayti, because there cannot be found people to comprehend
its true virtues, he says, “There cannot be
found throughout the dominions of Christophe ten
men who can read fluently; and there certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
cannot be found one sufficiently learned to comprehend
the meaning of the words military tactics,
geography, mathematics, fortification, &amp;c.”</p>

<p>Mazeres is certainly not altogether wrong; his
observations in the first paragraph are correct, with
the exception of his opinion of the affections of the
negro. It must, I think, be admitted that the affections
of the negro race are somewhat warm and unalloyed;
and in no instance are they so feelingly illustrated
as in the solicitude evinced by the negro
for his offspring. To his children his attachment
is strong and unalienable; and he displays it on
leaving his home with the greatest fervour, and on
his return with every mark of gratitude and joy.
Mazeres would wish to sink the affections of the
negro to a condition below the instinct of the brute
creation; but that he is wrong I can pronounce from
experience, not only in Hayti, but in other quarters
in which that species of the human race exists. In
his second paragraph, he has gone too far in saying,
not “ten men can read fluently”; but if he had asserted
that, at the period of the revolution, when the
first acts of rebellion commenced, a few only could
“read fluently,” I think he would not have been
wrong, for I do not find that among the blacks, at
that period, any were at all learned, or had any
skill or knowledge in those branches of science which
he particularizes. This is exemplified in Toussaint,
Dessalines, and Christophe, not one of whom, at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
commencement of the struggle, had been instructed
in even the common branches of education. Dessalines
in particular could neither read nor write, with
the simple exception of signing his name. All the
three chiefs were indebted to foreigners for the elegant
style of language in which their proclamations
were written; and it is too great a stretch of vanity
and egotism to attribute them to the citizens of the
country, when it is so notorious that most of those
papers which issued from the bureau of Christophe,
and from the bureau of Count Limonade, were written
by Europeans, whom the former had admitted
into his confidence, and who were consulted by the
latter on all occasions of importance. Baron Dupuy
was doubtless a man well qualified for the office he
held as secretary to the king (Christophe), and to
whom has been given the credit of many of the state
papers of his sable majesty, and I know that such a
compliment is no more than what is justly due to his
talents; but were he present, he would declare that
he derived the highest possible assistance, in his productions,
from one or two foreigners who were acquainted
with the technicalities of official correspondence,
to which the Baron had not been accustomed,
and who therefore generally undertook to
correct any part of it that required such labour.</p>

<p>Baron de Vastey, who is a warm advocate for the
genius and talents of his countrymen, and exceedingly
severe upon the opinion of Mazeres, says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
“See the grown children planning the construction
of impregnable fortresses, building palaces, calculating
almanacks, possessing black writers, poets, and
ministers of state.” Now I really have not been
able to discover where these impregnable fortresses,
planned by Haytians, are to be found. I believe
that when the Baron wrote there was not one single
fortification erected from the design of a Haytian;
they were the old works of the French repaired,
where such repairs were wanted. The Citadel
Henry, or Fort Ferrier, is the only new fortress of
which I have heard, and that was not constructed
from the design of a Haytian, but from the plan of a
British officer, from whom it takes one of its appellations,
Ferrier. The same thing is true with respect
to the palace Sans Souci. The only merit to which
the Haytians can lay claim, in the erection of
these works, is the preparing the materials, and the
labour of carrying them to the spot on which they
are built: for the whole of those materials for building
which could not be obtained on the spot, were
carried from other parts on the shoulders of the
people, and Christophe compelled blacks and browns,
young and old, boys and girls, of all ages and denominations
of citizens, to perform that labour which
ought to have been performed by brutes. Young
and interesting girls were to be seen carrying bricks
or boards up the mountains, almost ready to sink
under their loads, followed by soldiers with fixed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
bayonets or the sabre; but on this subject both De
Vastey and Prince Saunders are silent. As to writers
and poets, I have only heard of those now mentioned,
De Vastey and Larnders, except Chandlatte,
Count de Roziers, who, I imagine, being something
of poet-laureate to the king, governor-general of the
play-house, prepared pieces for representation, teeming
with the most fulsome compliments to the monarch’s
virtues, and wrote sonnets to the peerless
beauties of the queen and the princesses. Here, I
believe, ends the catalogue of architects, poets, and
writers of Hayti; and unless the Baron de Vastey
can adduce other proofs of Haytian capacities, I
must be excused if I still remain sceptical. I must
wait to see what time and a further intercourse with
the world will accomplish; at present but little of
that improvement manifests itself which has been
the subject of so much praise and admiration. That
the people of Hayti should improve, and that society
should become refined, I confess I wish may be realized,
but at this moment it is very distant from it.</p>

<p>Christophe was particularly anxious to improve
the face of his country, by making every exertion
to divest it of all those appearances of dilapidation
effected during the war; and by commanding all the
nobility, and persons attached to the state, to erect
magnificent houses on their estates, and otherwise
to ornament the plantations in the vicinity of their
residences, so as to give the whole an air of grandeur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
equal, if not superior, to former times; but in this
he did not succeed, except in a few instances, the
poverty of the people who had been raised to their
new dignities, putting it out of their power to comply
with his demand.</p>

<p>After the fall of Bonaparte in 1814, the ministers
of Louis XVIII. sent out commissioners to Hayti
to try what could be accomplished by a negotiation
with the two chiefs on the subject of the admission
of France to the sovereignty of the island. By these
emissaries an indirect menace was held out, forgetting
that by harsh measures no good could be done.
De Medina, who was the commissioner deputed to
Christophe, had served in the army of Toussaint,
and afterwards betrayed his cause and joined Le
Clerc. Such an individual was an object of considerable
suspicion to Christophe, and from some
irregularity which ensued respecting the credentials
of Medina, he was arrested, and his papers seized.
On the examination of the papers, it was discovered
that his aim was to excite insurrection and
disorder among the people, and endeavour to prevail
upon them to recognize Louis XVIII. as their
sovereign, that monarch assuring them of his paternal
solicitude, and of his pledge that they should
retain their property and military rank.</p>

<p>Christophe brought Medina to trial, and he was
found guilty by a military tribunal of the charges
which had been alleged against him. He was committed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
to the prison of the Cape, and it was said
died in confinement; but no accounts were given
afterwards respecting him, or of the fate which befell
him.</p>

<p>Monsieur Lavaysse, who seems to have been the
chief commissioner, and who had at the same time
proceeded to Port au Prince, for the purpose of
carrying on a similar negociation with Petion, met
with no better success,&mdash;except that having been
more cautious he avoided the fate of Medina,&mdash;as
that chief was well informed of the nature of his
mission, and was prepared to give a decided negative
to the propositions of the French crown; and the
rejection of his proposals was conveyed to M. Lavaysse
in a way very flattering to him, nothing being
evinced like the passion or violence exhibited by
Christophe during the progress of these negociations.</p>

<p>I happened to be in Jamaica at the time of the
arrival of the French commissioners, who touched
there on their passage for Hayti; and I was often
in company with Lavaysse after his return from his
unsuccessful mission, and I heard him speak in high
terms of the conduct of Petion for promptness and
decision, whilst he was warm against the harshness
of Christophe. This however might have emanated
from the former offering to the French a pecuniary
indemnity for his dominions, although he would not
recognize France as having the sovereignty; whilst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
Christophe would receive no proposals from France
on the one hand, nor would he submit to any claim
for pecuniary compensation on the other.</p>

<p>After the failure of this mission, the French king
declared officially that Monsieur Lavaysse had exceeded
the power which had been delegated to him;
but such a disavowal had no effect on the people, who
were more determined than ever to resist the admission
of French influence into the country. Other
attempts were afterwards made, and commissioners
were appointed to proceed to Hayti, with powers
from the king of France; but although they proceeded
round the island, and sent letters on shore at
different places, yet they received no attention, and
consequently they thought it advisable to give up
the object of their mission as impracticable; and I
believe no attempt was afterwards made during the
sway of either of these chiefs.</p>

<p>As Hayti might then be considered perfectly
secure of her independence, and as a strong feeling
pervaded the people of the north as well as the
south against the French, the two governments,
although there had not been any relations of amity
established between them, proceeded in the work of
civilization and general improvement in their divisions,
without being apprehensive that their tranquillity
would be interrupted by the encroachments of
either. Christophe was unquestionably, as has been
before observed, better qualified than his rival to govern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
a people like the Haytians, from his being naturally
of a determined and resolute temper, and not
to be alarmed by the consequences of his measures,
however tyrannical, harsh, or oppressive; and therefore,
aided as he was by men of capacity, he enforced
so rigid a system of government, and exacted from the
people so complete a submission to his will, that the
north, over which he reigned, presented an aspect of
affairs quite different from that of the south. Agriculture
was smiling, the produce of the soil increasing
considerably, whilst commerce was making rapid
progress, and bidding fair to become equally advantageous
to the state. Both contributed to the
revenue, making it sufficiently ample for all the exigences
of government, and consequently there were
no calls upon the people of any importance in the
way of taxation.</p>

<p>The government of Petion, on the other hand,
relapsed into a system of relaxation which subsequently
proved the bane of his country, and ultimately
brought upon him all those unhappy difficulties
which he experienced previously to his death.
After he had permitted his people to follow their
own indolent inclinations, and indulge in the propensities
inherent in the negro race, he found it impossible
to prosecute measures for the advancement
of the wealth and prosperity of his country similar
to those which his rival had so successfully pursued.
Agriculture had sunk to the lowest possible ebb, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
cultivators being allowed to follow their own inclinations.
Instead therefore of industry and a spirit of
emulation displaying itself through his dominions,
scarcely any thing was to be seen but men and their
families indulging in idleness, and in those lusts and
vices which could only entail wretchedness on themselves,
and poverty on their country.</p>

<p>Although Petion had laws, doubtless, by which he
might have enforced from the people the cultivation
of the soil, and prevented them leaving their plantations,
except on those days particularly enumerated,
yet he never seems to have attended to the spirit of
the laws and have insisted upon their due execution,
but simply to have contented himself with the
mere letter, without in the least reflecting on the
serious consequences that would inevitably flow from
his want of that resolution and decision which formed
so prominent a feature in the character of Christophe.
The mild and soft disposition of Petion disqualified
him to be the head of such a rude and untaught
people as those over whom he was appointed
to preside. Far from possessing the unrelaxing and
unrelenting temper of his rival, he was kind, indulgent,
and humane. Over a country so disorganized,
and over a people so prone to every vicious propensity,
and regardless of their own as well as the public
good, a man of more nerve, and not so sensible to the
finer feelings of our nature, would have been better
calculated for governing than President Petion, who,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
in the language of a writer on his country, was said
to be “of a sensible and humane character; tutored
in the schools of Europe, his mind has received an
expansion that fits him for the helm of government,
and his exterior an address that would distinguish
him in a court. Ill suited perhaps to witness scenes
to which his station as a military commander exposes
him in the field of battle, the tear of sensibility
often bedews his cheek at the sight of slaughter, and
though brave, enterprising, and bold, he values more
the responsive glow of a humane act than the crimsoned
laurel he has plucked from the brow of his
adversary. He sighs at the purchase of victory with
the sacrifice of those subjects whom he loves: in
short, nothing can be more descriptive of his peculiar
virtues than the motto of an English artist at
the foot of his portrait&mdash;‘Il n’a jamais fait couler
les larmes de personne.’”<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>The character given of Petion by Mr. Walton,
I have heard confirmed by all classes of people in
Hayti, and by those who are well versed in the
dispositions of their countrymen; whilst admitting
it, however, they were not backward in expressing
their opinion that he was of too easy and too lenient
a temper to enforce those measures which the exigences
of the government so loudly and imperatively
called for. Through such leniency and indulgence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
therefore, his country relaxed to an alarming
degree in both agriculture and commerce, and
he was driven, for the purpose of supplying the
wants of government, to means which, although
they brought temporary relief, were finally most
baneful and ruinous. The revenue arising from the
produce of the soil was small, from his not enforcing
the culture of it to that extent which he might have
done, considering the strength of the population;
and the imposts on foreign manufactures fell infinitely
below his estimation, from the reduction of
the duties on British goods, and from the little encouragement
given to foreigners by the diminished
means of the people to purchase their commodities.
Had he pursued the same coercive system which
his rival Christophe adopted; had he compelled
his people to cultivate their lands, by which his
means of export would have been much increased;
and had he enforced from the proprietors of the
soil a strict attention to its cultivation, instead of
allowing them to indulge in the most sensual appetites
which can disgust our feelings, he would
have aggrandized his country, and have raised it to
the summit of affluence and prosperity. Had he
taught the people to know artificial wants, and encouraged
a desire for luxuries, he would have increased
the resources of his country, and the
burthens of the people would not have been heavier.
The means for supporting the state would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
been indirect, and consequently would not have
excited any discontent; which his successor has experienced
in no ordinary a degree. From these
sources, therefore, forming, as I believe they do, the
principal sources of revenue in all countries, he obtained
much less than the extent of his dominions
led him to anticipate, and consequently he became
greatly involved, and was necessitated to devise
other means of supporting his government.</p>

<p>The first thing which was suggested was a fictitious
or debased currency, which in the opinions of
most people is very little better than swindling
under the sanction of government; especially a
government like that of Petion, reduced to so low
an ebb as to have been without a dollar in its treasury,
and without any ostensible means of bettering
its miserable condition, or adding to its pecuniary
means. Every country has probably a fictitious circulating
medium, and I shall not condemn it, or question
its propriety, when the country is capable of redeeming
it at any specific period, or at its pleasure:
but when a country like Hayti has recourse to a
debased currency, it is very little better than an imposition.
Petion was without the means of raising
money, even upon the demesnes of government, for
the exigences of the state, so that it was impossible
for him to hold out any security to the people, that
his fictitious coin would be called in at any distant
period, unless he did so at a very large discount.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
He issued in the first instance three millions of dollars
in value in pieces of metal, a composition of
about nineteen parts of tin and one part silver, and
subsequently a further issue of a million of dollars
in value. This measure of temporary relief proved
a serious injury to his country, for it not only enabled
him to carry on the business of his government for
a time without any calls on the people, which, in its
then impoverished condition, was exceedingly improvident,
but it was the occasion of a great consternation
among the foreign merchants whom he
had induced to settle in his dominions, and who from
great apprehension of the consequences began to look
around them and to confine their commercial operations
within very contracted limits. They lost their
confidence in the stability of the government, and
consequently, as their importations gradually fell off,
the revenue fell infinitely short of the anticipated
returns.</p>

<p>He commenced also another system, which
proved exceedingly injurious to his finances, and
I cannot see how he could have contemplated any
other result. For the encouragement of the agriculturists,
the government, whenever the price of
the several products were low, bought very largely
of some of them, for the purpose of raising their
value, by which impolitic measure, they not only
lost considerably by their trading system, but it
had a most pernicious effect in driving foreigners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
out of the market, who would always cease to buy
the moment the government attempted to raise the
market value beyond what the value in the European
markets warranted. Of these speculations of
the government I had some little knowledge in my
mercantile capacity in Jamaica, for it was through
that island that most of Petion’s government produce
found its way to England; and on the estimated
value of it, very large sums in specie were
sent to Port au Prince from Jamaica, the moment
the proper documents of its being shipped were received.
These measures of the government were
exceedingly injudicious, for it raised the price of
their products so much above the European markets,
that the foreign merchants could not think of touching
them; and it finally proved the most injurious
system that could ever have been devised for upholding
the exigences of any government. Had
he enforced those laws which had been passed for
the cultivation of the soil, and put all the estates
of the government into tillage, and conducted them
upon a judicious principle of management, as his
rival Christophe had done in the north, all his
wants would have been supplied, the distresses
under which he daily laboured would have been
averted, and his treasury, like Christophe’s, would
have been always liberally replenished, without obliging
him to resort to ways and means which proved
in the end so injurious to him. It is therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
evident that Petion was not calculated to govern a
people like the Haytians. His mildness of temper
would never allow him to adopt coercive measures to
raise his country to opulence; he restrained those
who were disposed to insist on the cultivators doing
their duty as pointed out by the law for the encouragement
of agriculture.</p>

<p>To this Christophe was the very reverse, for he
not only called upon the magistrates and other officers
to see the law for the cultivation of the soil
rigidly executed, and take into custody all those who
committed the least breach, but, daily accompanied
by his staff, he absolutely rode personally to different
parts to ascertain whether the cultivators were
doing their duty. He well knew those whom he had
to govern, and also that were he once to allow them
to give way to their love for indolence, it would in
time become invincible, and therefore he adhered to
the old rule, that a preventive is better than a cure.
The consequences were, that from his system of coercion
the calls of his government were provided for,
the people individually advanced in wealth and security,
and the cultivators, who would otherwise have
been in a state of sloth and misery, disease and
wretchedness, lived well, and were contented. The
condition of cultivators under Petion’s mild government,
and under whom there was no such thing as
coercion, presented a striking and instructive contrast;
indolent and unconcerned, they passed their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
time like animals without the least exertion, and without
a thought beyond the supply of their immediate
wants; and those wants being provided for, they
again sunk into apathy and indifference. Lust and
every vicious propensity obtained an unlimited sway
over them, and to feed their sensual appetites and
satiate their brutal passions seemed to form the only
object which they studied. Disease became prevalent,
poverty accompanied it in all its ravages, and a
more wretched, miserable race of human beings could
not have been selected than might be seen in different
parts of the country over which the sensible
and humane Petion ruled.</p>

<p>This was the state of the country over which
Petion presided previously to his death, which lamentable
event took place on the 29th of March,
1818, after an illness of no long duration, but attended
with circumstances that excited the greatest
sympathy for his sufferings. It was generally admitted
that the state of his country had produced
an extraordinary depression of spirits, which no
exertions of his most intimate friends could remove.
Medical aid became unavailing, he lingered, but
without, it appears, enduring any pain, and at last
sunk under the weight of accumulated distress of
mind, brought on by the deranged state of his finances
and the impoverished condition of his country.
Petion was undoubtedly a good man, and greatly
beloved by his people, who valued him for his mild<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
and inoffensive manners, and for the courtly and
unassuming conduct which he always manifested to
every one who approached him. The day on which
he died the people assembled in the square opposite
to the government-house, waiting with the most
painful anxiety to learn if all hopes of his recovery
had vanished, and towards twelve o’clock at night,
when the gun fired to announce that he was no
more, the cries and moans of all classes were heard
through the different streets as they were verging
towards the square.</p>

<p>This was not the most dreadful part, nor that
which excited the greatest anxiety; those inhabitants
who had experienced the changes which
had taken place during the time of Dessalines,
and had seen the massacres of that wretch, began
to fear a similar catastrophe during the interregnum,
from the rude state of the negro population,
from their relaxed state of morals, and from a
spirit of ungovernable insubordination, fostered by
the ill-judged mildness and leniency of the late
President. The foreign merchants were alarmed,
and apprehensive also of confusion as well as the
probability of the destruction of their property;
their fears in this respect were however fortunately
unfounded, as nothing occurred which indicated the
least disposition towards hostility and molestation.
Petion had designed Boyer for his successor, who was
immediately after his decease accordingly declared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
President in the customary form, and took upon
himself the administration of the government.</p>

<p>At the death of Petion, Christophe indicated no
wish to interfere with the election of Boyer, who preserved
the tranquillity of his dominions. Christophe
was still pursuing his system of aggrandizement, and
had realized a very large sum of money in his treasury,
with which he contemplated the purchase of the
Spanish territory and to annex it to his dominions;
and for this purpose he had actually commenced a
negotiation through the agency of some powerful individuals
in London. This design unquestionably
evinced great judgment, for it would have given him
a decided superiority over the southern government,
and he could have menaced all their points, and
having a larger force would have been able to make
considerable impression on their principal posts of
defence; but his death, which took place in October
1820, put an end to the negotiation, and established
the union between the north and south,
uniting them in one government, designated “The
Republic of Hayti.”</p>

<p>The system pursued by Christophe had become
too despotic for the people; exceeding the bounds
of prudence, his ambition had no limits, and his
tyranny and oppression became at last so insupportable
that neither the people nor his troops would
any longer submit to his power and caprice. A
revolution ensued which began with the revolt of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
the garrison of St. Marc, the commandant of which
sent a courier to Boyer to inform him of the event,
and of the wish of the people to place themselves
under his government. Shortly after, the city of
Cape Haytian followed the example, and the troops
were preparing to march against Christophe who
was confined by sickness at Sans Souci. His guards
now revolted, and finding all chance of escape impossible,
he shot himself with a pistol in his own
chamber. His sons were killed by the troops, as
well as several of his officers of state who were obnoxious
to the people and the soldiers. His eldest
son, it was said, exhibited the most abject submission,
and begged them to save his life; whilst his
youngest defended himself with great heroism, killing
several of the soldiers, but was at last cut down
and shockingly mangled.</p>

<p>His wife and daughters were spared through the
interference of Boyer, who sent them to Port au
Prince by water, with instructions that they should
be particularly protected, and not disturbed by the
citizens; and after his return to the city, permission
was given them to leave the country, which
they accepted, and sailed for England, where they
were received, by those persons who were admirers
of Christophe, with some respect and attention. A
small estate was secured to them, and Madame
Christophe’s jewels, which were valuable, were restored
to her, and I have reason to believe that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
she is in possession of an income which, although
not splendid, is quite enough for the purposes of
genteel life. She was considered a good and humane
woman, and often softened the anger of her husband,
who was addicted to sudden gusts of passion,
and to the infliction of punishment with unjust severity.
But notwithstanding his impetuosity of
temper, he was the only man who was competent
to preside over a people in the state of ignorance in
which his subjects were. He not only possessed the
discernment necessary to discriminate between that
which was advantageous to his country and that
which was injurious to his interest, but he had the
courage and resolution to enforce the one and prevent
the other. Had Christophe lived he would
have raised his country in affluence and in civilization,
but his death has sunk the former, and retarded
the latter; and the people, now left to pursue
with an unlimited range their own propensities, will
dwindle again into that condition of ignorance
which is characteristic of the early periods of the
revolution.</p>

<p class="pn2"><span class="smcap">Jean Pierre Boyer</span>, who succeeded the late president,
Petion, and who consequently became chief
of the countries of his predecessor and of Christophe
united, is a native of Port au Prince, and is about
forty-eight or fifty years of age. He is a mulatto,
but somewhat darker than the people of that class.
His father, a man of good repute and possessed
of some wealth, was a store-keeper and a tailor in
that city. His mother was a negress of the Congo
country in Africa, and had been a slave in the
neighbourhood. He joined the cause of the Commissioners
Santhonax and Polverel, with whom he
retired, after the arrival of the English, to Jacmel,
when he joined General Rigaud, whom he accompanied
to France, after the submission of the south<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
to the authority of Toussaint. On his voyage
thither he was captured by the Americans, during
the short dispute between France and the United
States, and after the adjustment of the differences
between those two powers he was released. Having
resided in France some time, he, with many other
persons of colour, attached himself to the expedition
of Le Clerc, and accompanied that armament
for the subjugation of the colony: but on
the death of that general, he joined Petion, who
successively appointed him to be his aid-de-camp,
private secretary, chief of his staff, general of the
arrondissement of Port au Prince, and finally
named him for his successor in the presidential
chair.</p>

<p>Boyer is below the middle size, and very slender;
his visage is far from being pleasing, but he has a
quick eye, and makes a good use of it, for it is incessantly
in motion. His constitution is weak, and
he is afflicted with a local disease, which compels
him to be exceedingly abstemious. He is fond of
parade and exterior ornaments, as is the custom of
the country, but he does not display his propensities
for them, except in compelling those of his
staff and household to appear in all their embellishments.
He is but little seen among his people,
except on a Sunday, when he appears at the head
of his troops, and after reviewing them he rides
through the city, attended by a cortége of officers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
and guards. He is exceedingly vain of his person,
and imagines that it is attractive and captivating,
and that his manners are irresistible.</p>

<p>I shall now proceed to notice a few of the proceedings
of Boyer after his elevation to the supreme
command in the republic.</p>

<p>I remarked in the last chapter, that the commander
of the troops of Christophe at St. Marc,
on finding that his soldiers had determined on a
revolt, had sent to inform Boyer of the circumstance,
and invited him to proceed to that place
and take possession of it. No sooner had Boyer
received this intimation than he made preparations
to march into the north. He took only a few
troops, consisting of his horse and foot guards,
being aware that there would be no resistance
to his advance, and that the people were ready to
submit to him without any opposition. This was
pleasing to the president, who, as it has been
observed before, never shewed any disposition for
hostile measures, and that fighting was a trade
to which he was unaccustomed, and for which he
had no predilection. On his arrival at St. Marc,
he received the submission of the inhabitants, and
was joined by the revolted troops of Christophe;
and he also received information of the death of
that chief, and that General Paul Romain, Prince
du Limbé, had declared for the republic. He had
therefore nothing to apprehend from any interruption<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
likely to be given to his advance. On the 21st
of October, 1820, he entered Gonaives, which
received him without any opposition, and on the
22d he proceeded for the city of Cape Haytian, and
the capital of Christophe, the inhabitants of which
had made great preparations to receive him; he
entered it the same night at the head of 20,000
men, and on the 26th he was proclaimed president
of the north. General Romain called upon the
people to receive the president with every demonstration
of joy, and to acknowledge the people of
the south as true Haytians and brothers, with the
usual salutations of “Long live the Republic of
Hayti!” “Independence, Liberty, and Equality!”
and “President Boyer!”</p>

<p>After the first acclamations of the people had in
some measure subsided, Boyer, by the advice of
his officers and the chief people of the north, began
to make such arrangements for incorporating the
north with the southern government as were requisite
and imperative for the better administration of
the united districts. The troops of Christophe were
also removed from their stations to others in the
south, whilst those of the south, in some cases, succeeded
them: and those general officers who had
taken prominent parts in bringing about the revolution
were confirmed in their rank; but as the
government was republican, all distinctions of title
were abolished, and the designation of citizen was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
adopted, as in the south. Some of those who were
raised to titles by Christophe, and had survived
the revolution, were well pleased to be disrobed of
the trappings of nobility, because it entailed upon
them an expenditure beyond their scanty means.
The Baron Dupuy told me that he was pleased
with the designation of citizen, whilst the appellation
of baron had always sounded disagreeably to
him. Noble distinctions, he said, suited those
only whose conduct was noble, and who had by their
virtues truly earned them. For his part he was
not aware that he had accomplished any thing that
ought to have raised him above his fellow-citizens.
There is reason to fear that the Baron Dupuy was
the only man in Hayti possessing such modest and
unassuming ideas.</p>

<p>After the events of the revolution in the north,
and the arrangements for the government of that district
had been completed, Boyer made preparations
for his return to Port au Prince. Elated with success,
and vain of what he termed his unexampled
career of glory derived from the downfall of his rival
chief, he signified a wish that his entrance into the
city of government should be attended with some
pomp and demonstrations of joy suitable to the
occasion. Accordingly, those of his suite who
knew that nothing could be more gratifying to the
president than show and parade, prepared for a
triumphant entry, and at the northern gate an arch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
was constructed and ornamented with a variety of
devices celebrating his victory. But it having been
communicated to Boyer anonymously, that some
disaffected individuals were conspiring to shoot him
as he passed through this arch, he arrived at the
government house by a circuitous route, before the
whole was completed, and without the knowledge
of the populace. He began to make some inquiry respecting
the intelligence he had received, but it was
soon suspended, as it was suggested by his chief
officers that he would be acting wisely not to prosecute
it further, as it might tend to fan the flame
of disaffection rather than smother it.</p>

<p>The union of the north effected by this revolution,
did not seem at all gratifying to the people of
the south, as they had imbibed a great dislike to the
inhabitants under Christophe’s government, from
the civil feuds that had existed, and by which their
lives and property had so often been in jeopardy.</p>

<p>The revolution in the north was followed by a
similar event in the eastern or Spanish part, which
took place at the end of the succeeding year. The
first symptoms of the latter manifested itself in the
city of Santo Domingo, the capital of the east. A
deputation formed of the principal inhabitants waited
on President Boyer at Port au Prince, and tendered
the submission of the people of the east to
the republic, and soliciting that their country might
be incorporated with it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>Boyer no sooner received the communications of
the deputies, than he began to march a force towards
the Spanish frontiers, which he immediately followed
with his staff; the whole as they advanced
receiving on their route the congratulations of the
inhabitants and expressions of good will and prosperity
to the republic. In the Spanish part at this
time there were a great many of the Haytians who
had taken up their residence as cultivators, and had
made some progress in their little plantations; these
with the people of colour formed the largest proportion
of the inhabitants; and when the measure of
union with their western islanders was first suggested
by the leading men in the city of Santo
Domingo, a ready acquiescence was shewn by them,
and a wish expressed that it should be proposed to
Boyer without delay. On the arrival of the president
in the city, the people displayed their satisfaction
at being united to his government, and he
with the same manifestations of pleasure assured
them of his protection and good will. Such arrangements
as were adviseable for the future government
of the east were made without much delay, and
General Borjellas was left in command of the city,
and to carry into effect those plans which had been
determined upon by the president and the people.</p>

<p>By the annexation of the eastern part therefore,
the whole island became subject to one government.
From Cape Tiburon to Cape Samana, and from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
Cape Nicolas Mole to Cape Engano, the power of
Boyer extended, leaving no competitor to disturb
his arrangements, nor to attempt to defeat those
views which he contemplated for the preservation
and repose of his dominions.</p>

<p>That a work of such magnitude should have been
accomplished in so short a period, and without even
the loss of blood and lives, seems more like the effect
of magic than the result of the efforts of man; and
so exceedingly vain was Boyer of the event, that
he was known to declare that he thought himself
like Bonaparte, and that he was endowed with almost
supernatural power, and an agent of the Divine will
to scourge those who had previously oppressed the
people. He believes nothing to be the result
of chance, or the effect of time and misrule; and
arrogates to himself the capacity of accomplishing
any thing which he may design and wish to execute.</p>

<p>After having reduced the whole island quite
under his subjection, it was thought that Boyer
would take into his immediate consideration its
condition so far as regarded agriculture, commerce,
and finance; and that he would resort to
wise and judicious means by which the prosperity
of the whole would be greatly promoted: that
he would infuse a spirit of emulation into the cultivators,
because there was nothing to interrupt
their tranquillity, and they might pursue their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
labour unmolested and undisturbed. But this was not
done; he seemed to be quite insensible to the good
effects that would result from the encouragement
of agricultural labour; and his people became so
perfectly obstinate and indolent, that nothing could
be obtained from them. Commerce also, which in
the time of Petion began to decline, grew worse,
and as the country produced but little, the people
had the means of supplying but few wants: in fact
it appeared very evident that Boyer wished to adopt
a system of governing different from that which had
been pursued by any of his predecessors. His plan
has been to keep his people ignorant of artificial
wants. By this means he expects the more easily
to obtain from the produce of the soil the supplies
required for the wants of government: in this he
persists against all the suggestions of those persons
who are capable of pointing out the disadvantages
that must accrue from this line of policy. Finding
his wants great, and that he had no means of supplying
them from the products of the soil, or from
the revenue arising from his commercial intercourse,
he was driven to a fresh issue of debased coin, and
to the project of working the mines in the different
parts of his dominions, forgetting that the finest
mine which Hayti possessed was in that soil, the
very rich and productive quality of which was the
theme of every man’s praise. Nothing can shew
greater ignorance than considering gold and silver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
as real, instead of artificial wealth; or greater folly
than exploring mines, whilst agriculture is neglected.
The issue of the debased coin must, some time
or other, be attended with all those evils which the
inability to redeem it at its full value will inevitably
bring on, and particularly in a country the inhabitants
of which are in that very backward state of
knowledge, where its expediency,&mdash;if it could be
expedient to resort to an issue of it,&mdash;was beyond
their conception, or the nature of the loss caused
by it beyond their comprehension.</p>

<p>Another of Boyer’s inconsistent projects was his
scheme for inducing France to recognize the independence
of his country. Of all the impolitic measures
devised by man, this certainly must stand
preeminent for its folly; by his countrymen it must
be deprecated as a wild scheme which will, in all
probability, involve the republic in many difficulties.
It is well known that on the 1st of January,
1804, Hayti was declared to be independent, since
which period no attempts had been made, or steps
taken by the government of France to reclaim it, except
the visit of the commissioners in 1814, whose
mission Louis the XVIIIth declared was undertaken
without the authority of the crown, and consequently
disavowed. So that in point of fact
no attempt had been made by France to reassert its
sovereignty over the island. Having therefore been
independent de facto for twenty-one years, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
having, by repeated proclamations of the several
chiefs of government, and more particularly in the
fulsome gasconades of Boyer himself, exhibited an
unshaken spirit of hostility against French influence
and French dominion, is it not the most unaccountable
occurrence in the annals of almost
any country, that overtures should have been made
to France, to recognize an independence already
established and tacitly admitted? Could any man
in his senses, or set of men, have been so divested
of all reason, judgment, or penetration?
And is it not a circumstance unparalleled in the
political history of any country in the world? But
it is a fact, that the government of Hayti did in
May, 1824, send two agents, Rouanney and La
Rose, senators, to Paris, to negotiate for the recognition
of the independence of their country, openly
and avowedly admitting by it, that France still held
the sovereignty over it, and that it was to all intents
and purposes a colony, and an appendage to that
crown. These agents were empowered to offer a
very large pecuniary consideration, one hundred
millions of francs, with certain privileges of trade
over other nations; but the offer was rejected,
and the agents ordered to quit the country without
delay. The French cabinet had now got the
thoughtless Haytian in the toil, and was determined
to secure him; and no sooner was it known in
France that Boyer had granted to an English company<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
the privilege of working the mines in the eastern
part of his dominions, and that other operations
of a commercial nature would be connected
with it, than a fleet of fourteen sail of the line was
despatched under the command of Admirals Jarien
and Grivel, for the purpose of reducing the Haytians
to submission, and compelling them to acknowledge
France as holding a sovereign right over
them, or to accept of such terms for the recognition
of their independence as should be tendered.</p>

<p>In this fleet sailed the Baron Mackau, an officer
in the French navy, to whom was confided the business
of the negotiation on the part of the French
king; and certainly no man was better qualified for
such an important trust. It would indeed have been
impossible for any one to have displayed more
adroitness and diplomatic skill, or have executed
his mission with more satisfaction to his country:
in fact, to use a nautical phrase, he got the weather-gage
of the conceited Haytian.</p>

<p>The baron, it appears, was not altogether confined
to pacific measures, for on his arrival in the
harbour of Port au Prince the fleet shewed symptoms
of active work being in embryo, unless the
Haytians were disposed to submit to such terms as
might be offered. The admirals moored their ships
very judiciously abreast of the city, by which means,
if hostilities were unavoidable, they might be able
to make such an impression on it, as should alarm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
the people, and strike at once a decisive blow
against their capital. From the untenable state of
the several batteries and forts, any attempt at defence
would have been unavailing, for it is evident
that one line-of-battle ship could have demolished
the whole. The appearance of such a formidable
force before the city excited terror and consternation;
the object it had in view was unknown, and
it was unlooked for; and from the weak and defenceless
condition of the city, every thing seemed hopeless.</p>

<p>The president, all his officers of state, his troops,
and the inhabitants were alike in amazement; and
his <i>excellency</i>, instead of setting an example of
confidence, and exhibiting that spirit which, as the
head of his country, he ought to have displayed, to
rouse the energies of his people for defence, sunk
into a half stupor, and absolutely shut himself up
in his chamber, or closet, with his mistress and
her children. His officers looked at each other
like men bereft of reason through sudden fright;
and the troops&mdash;those soldiers who were to <i>brave
every difficulty, and defy the whole world</i>,&mdash;stood
motionless, fearing that every moment would
bring the signal of attack from their enemy. The
women and children were sent off into the mountains
in irregular droves, resembling the flight of a
scared multitude, some with such articles as they
could carry, and others without any thing. Upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
the whole it is impossible to describe the panic which
the arrival of the French occasioned; and I think
I may venture to assert, that President Boyer will
take great care that the Haytian historians shall not
record the event during his sway, lest they be too
minute in particularizing the conspicuous part he
bore, and the bravery which he displayed!</p>

<p>When the whole fleet was safely moored, two
officers of the president’s staff were despatched on
board to the commander-in-chief to ascertain the
object of their arrival, and they returned to the president
with communications from Baron Mackau,
explaining the nature of the mission with which he
was entrusted, assuring him that it was entirely
pacific, and that his master, the King of France,
actuated by the most philanthropic motives, and
in the spirit of the overtures which President Boyer
had previously made, had been induced to appoint
him as his representative to carry into effect such
arrangements with his subjects of Saint Domingo,
touching the recognition of their independence, as
should be consistent with the dignity of his crown
and the interests of his people. When this was
announced to Boyer, he recovered somewhat from
the alarm into which he had been thrown, and once
more put on an appearance of confidence and resolution.
When he heard that the object of the mission
was conciliatory, and that hostile measures
might be averted by submission to such propositions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
as might be offered, his mind became tranquil, and
he at once determined, <i>and his brave officers applauded
him for his decision, not to draw his
sword</i>, but rather to try the effects of supplication
on the sensible mind of the French diplomatist.</p>

<p>The next day Baron Mackau landed under a
salute from the forts, and proceeded to the government-house,
where he was received by the president,
surrounded by the great officers of state and those
of his staff. The same evening he was closeted with
the president and the secretary-general Inginac
for a considerable time, and entered upon the subject
of his mission. They came to no conclusion that
night, but the interview seemed to have been broken
off somewhat abruptly and unsatisfactorily to the
baron, who was necessitated to demand a prompt
decision, or he should be obliged to resort to those
measures for which he was so amply provided. The
same night, and immediately after the departure of
the baron to his hotel, a conference took place at the
bureau of the president between the secretary-general,
some members of the senate, and himself on the subject
of the propositions, and it was determined that
another interview should take place the next day at
the secretary-general’s house, and that he should be
deputed to make such arrangements as the exigence
of affairs required. The baron acquiesced in the
appointed meeting, and accordingly prepared himself
to meet the secretary-general, but without any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
disposition to relax in those demands which he had
made the night previous. The French cabinet,
it must be remarked, had provided the baron with
ordonnances of different degrees of propositions, already
prepared for presentation, acceptation, and
signature, and with these he proceeded to the place
of interview, first presenting that which was most
favourable for his country, and lastly, the one
which the secretary-general Inginac, in the name of
the republic, deemed it adviseable to accept, and
by which, should its several clauses not be complied
with, Hayti is admitted to be a colony of
France. The ordonnance is dated in Paris on the
17th of April, 1825, and signed by the king, and
sets forth, that the ports in the <i>French part of
St. Domingo</i> shall be open to the commerce of all
nations; that the French ships and merchandize
shall be admitted into the <i>French part</i> on paying
only half the duties exacted from other nations,
and the same on the exports thence; that the <i>inhabitants
of the French part of Saint Domingo</i>
agree to pay, in five annual instalments, the sum of
one hundred and fifty millions of francs as an indemnity
for the losses of the ancient colonists; and
that when the conditions of this ordonnance are fulfilled
<i>the French part of Saint Domingo</i> is declared
independent. When this ordonnance is particularly
considered, it will be seen that France has
been admitted to the sovereignty of Hayti, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
President Boyer when he accepted it, recognized in
Charles the Xth his future sovereign, at once declaring
himself to be only the nominal representative
of that monarch, and by the most extraordinary
weakness and precipitancy assigns over the independence
of his country, at once annulling that
constitution framed by his predecessors, which says,
“never again shall a colonist or an European set
his foot upon this territory with the title of master
or proprietor.”</p>

<p>The negotiations having been concluded on the
8th of July, preparations were made for proclaiming
their <i>independence</i> on the 11th, and a great
deal of ceremony and parade attended it. The
people of Port au Prince exulted at the idea of
being now placed beyond the possibility of disturbance
in their persons and property; but such
exultation was confined to the city alone in which
the celebration of the event was to take place.
Throughout the whole island, and particularly the
north and south, the intelligence was received with
great murmurings, and the negro cultivators began
to apprehend that they had been sold to the French
for the purpose of reestablishing slavery. At
Cape Haytien in particular the people shewed the
strongest symptoms of a disposition to revolt, and
in the neighbourhood all was ripening for resisting
the measures of the government. Boyer was informed
of it, and so powerful did it appear, that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
immediately ordered troops to advance for the purpose
of awing the people into an acquiescence in
the arrangements which had been made. He succeeded
in doing so; but although he discovered
the principals and seized them, yet fearing the consequences
that were likely to ensue from bringing
them to trial, he only directed them to be banished
to the south, confining the limits of their place of
exile to the vicinity of Jacmel.</p>

<p>A general officer, who commanded one of the
southern arrondissements, demanded from the secretary-general,
Inginac, the cause of so disgraceful a
concession on the part of President Boyer, and
declared that it was cowardly and treacherous to
the people. The secretary-general replied, “that
it was impossible to do otherwise, as the French
fleet lay off the city, and if the president had not
acceded to the ordonnance, the destruction of the
city would have followed, and then what would
have become of our wives and children, our properties
and the republic?” The general, who was a
negro, with a look of the greatest indignation, immediately
asked the secretary-general “if President
Boyer and himself considered the city of Port au
Prince alone the republic; and if that city had fallen
into the hands of their enemies, whether there were
not other places in which they might have taken
refuge, rather than have submitted to the disgrace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
of such an unprecedented treaty?” After the spirited
declaration of the negro general, it was intimated
to him that his presence was particularly required
at his place of command.</p>

<p>There were several fêtes given in Port au Prince
to Baron Mackau and the French officers, all of
which were only remarkable for the fulsome compliments
which flowed from the respective parties.
The French, who six months before were execrated
by the people, were received with every appearance
of esteem by those who had taken an active
part in these transactions. The ears of strangers
were continually beset by persons engaged by the
President to cry through the streets, “Vive Charles
the Xth!” “Vive le Dauphin de France!” “Vive
la France!” “Vive Haïti!” “Vive le President
d’Haïti!” “Vive l’Indépendence!”</p>

<p>Baron Mackau seems to have had a perfect knowledge
of the people to whom he had been sent, for
he dealt out his flattery with no unsparing hand, and
the avidity with which Boyer swallowed it excited
no little surprise among the French, and became
the subject of general talk with all classes of people,
Haytians and foreigners. Their noble struggle
against Le Clerc, and their courage and virtues,
were continually the subjects of the baron’s praise;
at other times, the progress and improvement in
the various branches of knowledge which the people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
had made, and above all, the high talents of Boyer,
his discernment and discretion, and his many good
and noble qualities.</p>

<p>The negotiation for independence having been
arranged, it was necessary, before the whole could
be concluded, that commissioners should forthwith
be sent to France for the final adjustment of some
differences which could not be provided for in
the preliminary treaty, and for the raising of money
by a loan for the payment of the first instalment
of the indemnity. The persons appointed
for the mission were, Mons. Rouanney, a senator,
who had been employed in the previous mission,
Mons. Daumec, a lawyer, and Colonel Frémont, aid-de-camp
of the President. Daumec, the only man
possessed of the least talent, was taken ill on his
passage to France, and died soon after his arrival
in that country. The duty therefore devolved on the
other two, who were incompetent for the management
of the important charge with which they were entrusted,
and their execution of it confirmed such a
conclusion. Rouanney was perhaps as little calculated
for diplomacy as any person that could have
been selected&mdash;he is a weak and superficial character,
a compound of vanity and presumption; and Frémont
could only have been nominated to display the
splendour of the Haytian military costume, and to
shew to the good people of France the magnificence
of the court of the redoubtable President of Hayti!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>They failed in their mission, for they were unable
to determine on any question that was submitted by
the French for their consideration, and consequently
the cabinet of France was driven to the alternative of
tendering to them the basis of a definitive treaty comprising
twenty-one articles, with which they were ordered
to return to Hayti, and to lay it before their
government for approval or rejection. Their return
excited no little astonishment; and when the document
of which they were the bearers was presented
to Boyer, he was anxious to accept it, but his council,
it appears, and the secretary-general, Inginac,
decidedly opposed it, alleging that if it were received
it would be compromising the honour and independence
of the republic; for it was a strange anomaly,
and bore no analogy to a definitive treaty of peace,
but in all its relative parts had a resemblance to a
convention between a king and his rebellious subjects.
Boyer therefore, much against his inclination,
rejected the treaty, but intimated to the French
cabinet his sincerity in wishing that such a treaty
had been concluded as would be reciprocally advantageous,
and establish a good understanding between
the two countries. He also pledged himself
to conform to the terms of the ordonnance of the
French king, by the admission of the ships of France
chargeable with reduced duties, and by providing
for the payment of the indemnity at the respective
periods at which the instalments became due.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>With respect to the loan for paying the first
instalment that fell due on the 31st of December
following, the commissioners, Rouanney and
Frémont, seem to have been totally ignorant of the
nature and effect of such a negotiation. They appear
to have been in a maze from the attractions of
Paris, and their understandings&mdash;if they ever had
any&mdash;warped by the influence of French intrigue,
for they concluded a contract, that not only exhibited
the greatest absurdity, but one that would
entail a most extraordinary loss upon their country
by its redemption; a loan that has excited the
risibility of the moneyed men who had a share in its
negotiation, and has displayed the incapacity of
the persons selected by the Haytian government to
represent it in a measure of so much importance.</p>

<p>Such was the state into which Boyer had thrown
the republic by his weak and most improvident
policy, and it required some skill and ingenuity to
avert the evil likely to ensue from it, for dissatisfaction
began to be prevalent. From the press of
Hayti being under the censorship of the government,
the proceedings with France relative to the
recognition of independence were not known in
many parts of the country, particularly amongst
the cultivators of the interior. Although forming
the largest proportion of the people, they had no
knowledge of the conditions on which the French
had acceded to the recognition, until the members<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
of the chamber of communes returned to the several
parishes which they represented, and explained
the whole of the measures pursued by the
president. No sooner was it made known that the
French were to receive one hundred and fifty millions
of francs as an indemnity to the old colonists,
and that the ships of France were to be admitted
on half duties, than a general murmur of disgust
was heard, and the members of the communes were
most justly censured for having countenanced an
act which would entail upon them endless trouble
and anxiety. The idea of paying so large a sum, or
even any money at all, for so insecure a boon as that
of the recognition by France, was declared to be
of all acts the most absurd and inconsistent; and
to admit them besides to a privilege of trade more
favourable than that which was conceded to England,
which had always been constant in her intercourse,
was deprecated as a measure which was likely to
bring down upon them the displeasure of that government,
particularly as the President had, only but
a very short time previous to his abject submission
to France, most unwisely abrogated the law of
Petion which admitted the manufactures and produce
of Great Britain into the ports of the republic
at lower rates of duty than those of other countries.</p>

<p>Such being the impression upon the generality of
the people, they hesitated not to say, that the admission
of the indemnity to France as a national debt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
by the legislative bodies was not binding upon the
people; for as they had gained their independence by
one of the greatest struggles in modern times, and as
they had supported it at the expense of a great deal
of blood, and as it had become indisputable from
twenty-one years’ possession, they could only consider
such conduct on the part of President Boyer
as the effect of weakness and that want of energy and
decision which ought to be conspicuous in the head
of any government; and therefore that they were
determined to resist any levies that might be attempted
for raising the amount of the instalments out
of their properties. In this predicament was Boyer
placed, and it was made the more awkward to him
from the cry of his people, “for arrangements with
England,” and “give the English privileges, and
down with privileges to France.” They were sensible,
they said, that the British government would
have protected them against the enemies of their
peace and independence; but now, from the precipitancy
of their own rulers, they were no better
than a colony of France again; and that England
could not hold out to them any expectation of support,
unless she embroiled herself in a war with her
neighbouring state.</p>

<p>Finding such to be the feelings of the people,
Boyer had recourse to an expedient which he
thought would appease their irritation, and once
more soften them to an approval of his conduct.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
He made indirect overtures to the British government,
and afterwards a direct communication, to
know if it were the intention of the King of
England to recognize the independence of his
country, as the King of France had been induced
to do; but no assurances were received, further
than that his Majesty, for the protection of
British commerce in the republic of Hayti, contemplated
to send out consuls to that country to
preside over the interests of British subjects; and
that if the Haytian government had any proposals
to offer, on which a treaty of commerce could be
entered into upon a reciprocal basis, it would receive
that attention which the nature of it demanded.
This disposition of the British government
was no sooner known in Hayti,&mdash;and I had
been the bearer of it to Boyer&mdash;than the people
manifested the highest symptoms of joy and satisfaction,
declaring that they were now at the acme
of their wishes. Boyer found it an act of prudence
to express similar feelings of pleasure, though he
secretly hated the English, and would have submitted
to any sacrifice rather than have seen them
triumphant in the opinions of the people; Inginac,
the secretary-general, was not only gratified at the
intelligence, but shewed openly that this was the
nearest wish to his heart, and as he had always
been much attached to the English from having
had a good deal of intercourse with them, there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
no event from which he could derive so much satisfaction
and happiness as to see the representative
of the commerce of Great Britain land upon their
shores. The inhabitants of the country considered
this as a tacit admission of their independence
by Great Britain, and Boyer encouraged such an
opinion.</p>

<p>It was, indeed, extraordinary to see the people
running towards the government-house to congratulate
Boyer when the intelligence was first made
public, and the respectable citizens congratulate
each other with the most happy countenances, as they
were likely to be secured in the enjoyment of their
properties. That their country would now prosper,
and advance in wealth and consequence when recognized
by the crown of England, seemed to them
certain; and they hailed it as an event of the
highest importance to their interests and to their
future aggrandizement.</p>

<p>From the moment of its being announced that
the British government had come to the determination
of sending out a consul-general to Hayti,
Boyer’s officers of state and the people in general
manifested the greatest solicitude for his appearance;
a solicitude, emanating from a great sense
of the importance which they attached to it. The
president suppressed his feelings, whatever they
might have been; but at times he could not resist
the temptation of condemning the delay which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
intervened between the appointment of the consul
and his departure from England; and he was
often heard to say, that he questioned the sincerity
of the British cabinet respecting such intentions,
and that he believed it to be only a
ruse de commerce. The inhabitants, however,
were of a different opinion; they knew the integrity
of the British government, and were confident
that its commerce would not be neglected, but promoted
and extended wherever it could be accomplished.
Under this conviction they began to consult
each other, and take into consideration in
what manner they should best evince their joy,
and shew those marks of respect to which a consul
from England was so justly entitled.</p>

<p>It was determined by them to receive him on his
landing with shouts and acclamations, and to conduct
him to his hotel, accompanied by the most
opulent and powerful of the citizens, and that the
city should be illuminated; but when their plans
were communicated to Boyer by the <i>presidential
spies</i>, he had it made known indirectly that such
manifestations of their pleasure would not only be
irregular, but that he should feel it as an insult
offered to himself, as he had not been consulted on
its propriety, nor applied to for his permission.</p>

<p>On the 25th of May, the consul-general and his
suite arrived in his Majesty’s ship Druid, Captain
Chambers; but as she did not appear off the harbour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
till nearly dark, she was not recognised by the government
officers, and consequently did not salute
before the following morning, when it was returned
by the forts, which was the only demonstration of
respect offered by the Haytian authorities on his
arrival. Nay, President Boyer could not conceal
his antipathy, nor restrain his dislike to the English,
even though he perceived that the presence of the
British mission had a strong tendency to reconcile
all classes of his citizens to his impolitic measures.
He individually neglected even to congratulate the
consul on his arrival; he did not pay him the common
civility of sending one of his aides-de-camp to
express himself friendly to the object of his visit,
as was the case on the arrival of the French consul-general,
to whom he sent two of his staff to offer
him <i>the assurances of his high consideration and
esteem</i>. The consul-general of England was only
visited by a subaltern of artillery on the staff of
General Inginac, and the general was absolutely
precluded paying a higher compliment to him by
the positive orders of Boyer; by the express order
of that very man who would have been subjected
to the animadversions, if not the hatred, of his citizens,
had not the British government sent out a
representative to give them something like an appearance
of protection against the intrigues of
France. He would no doubt have set the whole
of his citizens in a ferment, had it not been prevented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
by the timely arrival of the British consul-general,
when their animosity and irritation seemed
to have been softened by the gratification of seeing
the British ensign proudly waving from a British
man-of-war.</p>

<p>The consul-general, Mr. Charles Mackenzie, a
gentleman of the most refined and accomplished
manners, and possessing talents of the highest
order, received all this contumely with the most
perfect indifference, attributing it to a very just
cause. He knew that Boyer was secretly attached
to the French, that he cordially disliked the British,
that he had arranged with the French for the purpose
of giving that nation influence and privileges
in Hayti, and that any intercourse with England
was forced upon him by his people. He knew also
that Boyer was not the individual he was represented
to be; that he possessed neither enlarged
nor cultivated ideas, and had no correct knowledge
of the world; and consequently, from these circumstances,
he very judiciously put down all that show
of neglect on the part of the government to its
proper account, ignorance.</p>

<p>It is necessary now to advert to the proceedings
of Boyer after his arrangements with France, and to
see what steps he took to provide for the necessities
of the government, brought on in a very increased
proportion by the improvident measures
which he had pursued.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>In the first place, he called upon the legislative
body to sanction his treaty with France, to admit it
to have been both expedient and unavoidable, from
the situation into which the republic was thrown by
the unlooked-for appearance of the French armament
on their shores, and finally, by their entrance into
the harbour of Port au Prince, before any preparations
for defence could be made. No one entertained
any doubt respecting the issue of this question;
every person who knew how the legislative
body was constituted was aware that it would meet
with their acquiescence, that no member would have
the temerity to offer his dissent, and that it would
pass nem. con. In fact, there was no debate upon
the question; the measure was proposed, and passed
three times in one day.</p>

<p>Another important question also, submitted by
the president, was the indemnity promised to France.
He called upon them to declare it a debt of
the nation, and to devise such means as would
enable him to meet and liquidate it at the periods
when the respective instalments became due. This
met with some trifling opposition, but was however
carried, and immediately promulgated on the plea
that the honour of the republic and its credit would
be compromised were it not most rigidly and strictly
complied with.</p>

<p>When it was known through the country that the
representatives of the people had acceded to these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
two propositions of the president, the inhabitants
began to express themselves in language easily to be
understood, and to declare that they would not submit
to be burthened with the indemnity to France,
and that on no consideration whatever would they
contribute towards its liquidation, it never having
met with their concurrence: that they never wished
the recognition of their independence by France,
and in fact that the whole of the proceedings of the
government, with regard to the negotiations with
that power, ought to be universally execrated by
every citizen in the republic; and when it was further
known that an act had passed to compel each
arrondissement to pay its proportion as pointed out
under the law, they strongly expressed their determination
to resist a levy which they were neither
willing nor able to raise.</p>

<p>I had an opportunity of knowing the sentiments
of the people on this subject, from a communication
made to me by several of the most opulent of the
planters in the south-western part of the republic,
and it was made without any feeling of hostility
entertained on their part towards the government;
but they declared that the small cultivators, and
others composing the great mass of the population
of their district, were so exasperated at the concession
of such privileges to their enemy, that they
were confident that no force could compel them to
pay their quota of the indemnity, and that resorting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
to compulsory measures would only infuriate them
so much more.</p>

<p>The government from every quarter received the
most unfavourable intelligence respecting the impression
which their measures for raising this indemnity
had made, and the irritability which it
had excited; it was therefore deemed advisable to
try if it were possible to raise one or two of the
instalments by voluntary loans, to be redeemed in
thirty years, and to bear an interest of six per cent.
on the stock at par. If this could have been accomplished,
the compulsory measure would not have
been enforced, and the law would have remained
a dead letter; but the attempt proved unsuccessful.
The people had no confidence in the government,
and although every officer of the state contributed,
and even some British merchants, yet they could
not raise three hundred thousand dollars, and even
that sum has not been paid into the treasury.</p>

<p>Many citizens, on being applied to, to aid the contribution,
declined to render any assistance to a
measure which they declared to be pregnant with
the most pernicious consequences; for they had,
they said, no hesitation in avowing it to be their
opinion that the government never intended to repay
one shilling either of principal or interest,
and that they could not, consistent with their ideas
of justice towards their fellow citizens, give their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
sanction to so unjust and nefarious a proceeding.
They observed also, that as to faith in the integrity
of the government they had none; that under
no consideration would they lend it a dollar, for that
it was impossible for it to redeem any loan it might
obtain when it was fettered with a debt that was too
burthensome for the country; a debt contracted by
every species of weakness, and want of energy and
courage in those who were placed at the head of the
state.</p>

<p>In the eastern part of the republic, the people
were much more violent in their opposition, for they
openly remonstrated against contributing towards
the indemnity, alleging that they had not been an
integral part of the French colony at any time, and
that they would not be compelled to pay any proportion
of the debt contracted by the government for
a recognition of independence by France, because
they never acknowledged the right of that power to
any part of their division of the island. They had
voluntarily joined that part of the country under
Boyer’s government, but not with the supposition
that they were to submit to such an arrangement as
to pay any proportion of an indemnity which it was
thought proper to give to France for a recognition
of the rights of the people of the other extremity.
This was but just in the inhabitants of the Spanish
end of the island, and it would be unfair to condemn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
them for thus strenuously rejecting every attempt on
the part of the government to allure them into an
acquiescence.</p>

<p>It was pretty generally believed also, that this
determination of the people of the east was countenanced
by the officers who commanded in its several
districts, who were not backward in expressing their
dissatisfaction at the measures of the president; and
the latter found it advisable not to adopt any further
means for the raising of a loan in the country, but
to try what could be accomplished when the new
law for levying the contributions came into force.</p>

<p>Into this dilemma therefore has Boyer thrown his
country, and without any ostensible means by which
he can extricate it from the difficulties in which it
is involved. Oppressed with the weight of an overwhelming
debt, contracted without an equivalent&mdash;with
an empty treasury, and destitute of ways and
means for supplying it&mdash;the soil almost neglected, or
at least but very partially tilled&mdash;without commerce
and credit,&mdash;such is the present state of the republic;
and it seems almost impossible that, under the
system which is now pursued, there should be any
melioration of its condition, or that it can arrive at
any very high state of improvement. Any change
from the present would in all probability be worth
the experiment, but the existing inefficiency of the
government precludes the chance of any beneficial
alteration being effected. Hence there appears every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
reason to apprehend that it will recede into irrecoverable
insignificance, poverty, and disorder.</p>

<p>It must be manifest to every individual who visits
Hayti, and who devotes some little attention to the
state of the country, that the leaders in the government
mistake the true principle of governing, and
that their ideas of the most effectual way to exalt
their country are erroneous, wild, visionary, and inconsistent.
They are so excessively vain too of their
talents and discernment, that they think they have
framed a constitution the most pure and unobjectionable
of all the modern republics; and they arrogate
to themselves the merit of having perfected a
system that must eventually excite the admiration
and receive the approbation of the world. With such
arrogance on the part of her rulers, it is not surprising
that Hayti, instead of improving in her condition,
should greatly decline, and that her advancement
under such circumstances should be exceedingly
slow. Whereas, on the contrary, were the president
and his advisers to study the best interests of their
country, they would look round for information, consult
the experienced from every quarter, and court
advice rather than shun it. But so long as Boyer is
permitted to fill the presidential chair, this cannot
be expected; his vanity is too deeply ingrafted to
be easily rooted out, and labouring as he does under
the most extraordinary infatuation of his infallibility,
no good can be anticipated from his government,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
nor can the people be expected to advance in knowledge,
wealth, or prosperity.</p>

<p>The only department of government to which
Boyer seems to devote his attention is the military
establishment, and in this he is apparently sincere,
but without displaying those requisites which constitute
the capability of regulating the internal affairs
of that branch of the state. The standing force of
Hayti exhibits at once the absurdity of his measures,
and illustrates the folly of his arrangements with
France. It is stated by himself at forty-five thousand
men,&mdash;I say nothing of the national guards, one
hundred and thirteen thousand,&mdash;all well armed, well
disciplined, and completely found with every article
necessary for the soldier. If, therefore, his force
were as stated by himself, so powerful and well organized,
the only thing that can be said is, that he
must have been a most inefficient commander, and
in any other country would have been subjected to
the strongest animadversions, for not having opposed
the French force instead of submitting to such terms
as those to which he assented. Whatever may be
the numerical strength of the Haytian standing
army, its disposition weakens its power, and evidently
displays the incapacity of Boyer as a military
man, although his egotism, and the adulation of his
staff, would wish it to be understood that he is but
little inferior to the greatest captain of the age. It
is a known fact that he cannot, within any moderate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
period, concentrate at any given point five thousand
men; and notwithstanding their boasted discipline,
I have no hesitation in declaring that not one half
of such a body would be fit for active service on any
sudden call or emergency.</p>

<p>Let us look at the condition of a Haytian regiment
with respect to equipment for the field. I
have seen several of them in what was represented
to be marching order; and what was their state?
Some of the men are without even bayonets to their
firelocks, many without a cartouch-box, and some
without either belts, cartouch-box, or bayonet. Then
their uniform, too&mdash;that can hardly be described.
The coat ought to be of blue cloth, with red facings;
a cap similar to the French infantry, with the arms
of the republic, in brass, on the front of it, white
duck trowsers, and black gaiters. This I say ought
to be their uniform, according to the military regulation;
but the officers commanding regiments
are not quite so nice, not such strict disciplinarians
as officers in the British army, for the former are
not in the least particular should their men appear
either on parade, or in marching order, without
many of those articles which, by the latter of their
instructions would be considered indispensable. A
Haytian commanding officer looks to nothing but his
own personal appearance. If that has undergone the
survey of his chère amie and his fille de chambre,
he stalks forth to the head of his corps in all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
majesty of command, with his nodding plumes waving
to and fro, not unlike one of those heroes frequently
represented in some ballet or spectacle. He
has no concern for the appearance of his soldiers,
and consequently they exhibit one so extremely
outré, that I fear a description would scarcely obtain
credibility. Shoes are considered superfluities,
for in a regiment of four hundred men you will
not find many dozen pairs. Shirts again are not
required; as the jacket hides them, they are therefore
voted as unnecessary and extravagant. Their
caps in colour,&mdash;for they deem cleaning to be a labour
unbecoming a soldier,&mdash;which ought to be black,
resemble more the colour of the earth on which
they walk, and are generally applied for carrying it
when they are ordered on working parties, putting
them therefore to a very important use. And their
feathers, instead of standing perpendicular, are
mostly horizontal, because a soldier generally applies
his cap for the purposes of a seat in one instance,
and as an utensil for carrying water in the other.</p>

<p>I have heard a great deal about the courage of the
Haytian soldiers, and such a thing as bravery in all
probability did exist in the early periods of the revolution;
but whatever may be said to the contrary,
I am inclined to think that they are as deficient in
real courage as they are in every other requisite for
a soldier. High sounding and vaunting declarations
of their character for heroism, fortitude, and resolution,
on occasions of a very critical nature, I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
often heard from the citizens, but I have known,
from my own personal observation, of instances in
which they have shewn the most abject cowardice.
In ambuscade, or for irregular warfare, bush fighting,
or any similar operations, they may be useful;
but if they be ever brought in front of an enemy, to
contend for any position at the point of the bayonet,
or to perform any duty exposed to the menace of even
an inferior force, they will shew themselves exceedingly
deficient in courage, and quite on the alert to
fall back; and it will be seen also, that their officers
are not often to be found setting their men any example
of disregard of personal danger, or of giving
those proofs of innate valour and bravery which are
so characteristic of European soldiers.</p>

<p>The naval force of Hayti is inconsiderable. It
consists only of a brigantine of six or eight guns,
and about three schooners of four guns each, not one
of which is capable of leaving their own coast,
being badly equipped, worse manned, and the officers
quite ignorant of navigation, and they have about
five hundred sailors. The government bought a
vessel for the purpose of loading her with produce to
send to France, to pay a debt it owed there, and
they had not a Haytian who could navigate her, and
they were obliged to get a British subject of colour
to take the command. He went to Havre, and was
named “The Haytian.” This affords a fair specimen
of Haytian capacity.</p>

<p class="pn2"><span class="smcap">Whoever</span> has read the history of St. Domingo, and
has been impressed with an idea of its richness, of
its varied scenery, and of its fertile condition previously
to its feeling the ravages of the revolution,
and now contemplates the desolate appearance of
Hayti, will be astonished that such a contrast could
ensue; that a period of twenty-two years having
elapsed since the declaration of independence, there
should not appear some symptoms of improvement on
the face of the country; and that the people should
not have been anxious to restore the plantations to
their wonted state of productiveness. In my peregrinations
through the island, I was at times struck
with the extraordinary difference between what the
country was represented to be by the people themselves,
and its actual appearance in the different
districts through which I had an occasion to pass;
and a comparison of its once fertile state with its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
now sterile aspect only excites a greater astonishment,
and confirms my opinion of the indolence
and apathy of the inhabitants.</p>

<p>The original French part of the island was always,
as I have before observed, the most productive, because
a greater degree of industry prevailed among
the people. The eastern part of the island was never
much celebrated for aught but its pastures, and its
mineral productions, its mahogany and dye woods,
and its cattle of all descriptions. I shall present a
slight view of the present appearance of the country,
from my own observations, and from the notes of
others who have favoured me with a description, on
which every reliance may be placed, because I
have had their notes particularly scrutinized by
persons who are conversant with the whole of the
country, and on whose veracity I can safely rely.
I may differ in my detail from others who have
gone before me, but I have some hope that the account
which I shall give will command the assent
even of these persons. I shall commence with the
capital, noticing the country and the several places
on the coast, inland, and conclude with a few observations
on different parts of the interior.</p>

<p>The city of Port au Prince, which constitutes the
capital of the republic, is situate immediately at
the extremity of the bay of Port au Prince, and in
the centre of the department of the west. On its
north are the plains of Cul de Sac, environed by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
chain of mountains extending from the eastward to
the channel of St. Marc’s in the vicinity of L’Arcahaye.
To the east are the mountains of La
Coupe, the ascent to which commences immediately
without the walls of the city. And on the south
it is bounded by the plains and the bight of Leogane.
It is about a mile from the northern to the
southern gate, and from the sea to the eastern
boundary about twelve hundred yards. It was
formerly encompassed by a wall, and by several
forts of great strength; but the wall has fallen to
decay, and the forts are partly demolished, and are
now so much gone to ruin that they are quite incapable
of defence. At present there are forts Petion,
in which the bowels of President Petion are
deposited, Bazilles, La Croix, Le Marre, Islet,
Hospital, Leogane, Government, and one or two
of minor note, but they are all in such a state of
dilapidation that a salute adds greatly to their
weakness. Fort Islet is at the entrance of the harbour,
and the weakness of the President leads him
to think that its few guns, not more than six, would
stop the approach of an invading force; and with
this idea he has had it put into a proper condition
of defence; but it stands so low, that the guns of a
frigate brought to bear upon it would at once make
it quite untenable. In fact I am sure that a British
officer at the head of fifty men would desire no
better amusement than to storm it, particularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
when defended by such soldiers as the Haytians.
With regard to the others, I do not see that in
their present condition they can be defensible, for
their batteries are demolished, and not an embrasure
is left.</p>

<p>The streets are straight, running from north to
south, and from east to west, and are sufficiently
wide and commodious; but the roads are in such a
state as to be quite impassable for carriages; and
although the government levies a heavy tax for repairing
them, and the criminals sentenced to work
on them are numerous, yet but little is accomplished
towards putting them into a state of repair at all
suited for vehicles of any description, and after a
heavy rain they are totally impassable for people on
foot. The members of government are quite unconcerned
about any thing tending to improve the appearance
of their city, towns, or country; they seem,
from the President to the lowest individual, absorbed
in vice, living in sloth and sensuality, careless
of every thing, so long as they may be permitted
to indulge in the indolence and excesses so
predominant in the habits of the Haytian people.
The houses are merely the remains of such as stood
the ravages of the revolution, and those wooden edifices,
which were built since the two destructive fires
in 1820 and 1822, which consumed one third of the
city, containing all the most valuable buildings,
with property in them to a large amount. The city<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
therefore, to a stranger approaching it from the sea,
has an odd appearance, exhibiting nothing but
dilapidation and decay, or as if it had just suffered
from the effects of some violent convulsion; and
there seems no disposition to repair or improve it.
In the time of the French the whole of the streets
were paved, but the pavement since then has been
mostly destroyed and never repaired. The houses
on each side had verandas and trees in front of
them, whose foliage, impervious to the solar rays,
afforded the inhabitants a promenade, without being
exposed to the influence of the sun; but the
trees have been all destroyed, and only an occasional
veranda is to be seen. The public buildings
consist only of the government-house, the arsenal,
senate, and communes’ house, and it is no
difficult matter to describe them. The first was the
residence of the governor during the French régime,
and at that period must have been a splendid edifice.
It is low, as are all the houses in the West
Indies, built so on account of the frequency of earthquakes,
but it is commodious, and commands a fine
view of the sea. The gardens are represented to
have been splendid, and in the front was a fountain
(jet d’eau), which had a supply of water sufficient
for all the purposes of the governor’s establishment;
but they are now a mere waste, the
fountain destroyed, and the house externally exhibits
more the appearance of a barrack than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
seat of government. The arsenal is contiguous to
the sea, and might be destroyed by a gun-boat, for
it has nothing to defend it but a battery, mounting
two or three guns. It contains all the arms, artillery,
and ammunition of the government, and shews
the folly of the president who established it immediately
within the range of an enemy’s guns. The
senate-house is a low irregular building, and was
formerly used as a dwelling-house, and since that
period it has never received either repair or ornament,
for it is tumbling to pieces, and has a filthy
appearance, for the want of a little attention. The
communes’ house has more the appearance of a receptacle
for lunatics; and really if one were only to
visit it during the sittings of the chamber, it would
not be surprising if an impression were made that
the lunatics of the republic had congregated in it,
instead of reasonable men to deliberate upon the
affairs of their country. The cathedral has nothing
in its external appearance to point it out as a place
appropriated for divine worship; it is a square building,
with a single roof, without any steeple, with an
ascent to it of about three or four steps on the
western extremity. There is but little to attract in
the interior decorations and ornaments; the altar is
constructed of gew-gaws and tinsel; above it is a
painting by a modern artist, representing the union
of the blacks and people of colour. The figures
are two officers embracing; one is in the uniform of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
a general of hussars, and the other in that of a
general of infantry, one black and the other a
mulatto. The back ground represents a field of
battle in which the Haytians have just gained a
victory over the enemies of the republic. There is
an organ, but a small one, and not at all remarkable
for either its tones or its structure. There is nothing
else in the cathedral, and it is in fact a libel
on the name to call it one.</p>

<p>Upon the whole nothing can be said in favour
of the city of Port au Prince; and if it stood unrivalled
in point of elegance and splendour in the
time of the French, in the days and under the government
of President Boyer it is only remarkable
for ruins and every species of filth and uncleanliness.
It contains about thirty-five thousand inhabitants
of all classes.</p>

<p>The plains of the Cul de Sac, in the vicinity of
the city, were celebrated in former times for their
extreme productiveness, but they are now very little
cultivated; and passing through them from one extremity
to the other, from the sea on the west to
the lakes on the east, from the mountains of La
Coupe on the south, to those of Mirebalais on the
north, I could only discover now and then a patch
that had the least appearance of being tilled. On
ascending the mountains, and looking into the valley
below, the mind is at once struck with the inertness
and indolence of the people, and with the devastation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
that must have been committed during the revolt
of the slaves. Remains of houses and plantation
works are to be seen in every direction, scattered
implements for manufacturing sugar are spread
around you, and walls, which were erected for dividing
properties, as well as for the internal division
of the lands in cultivation, are thrown down and
mouldering, or overrun with the creepers and convolvulus,
and various other shrubs, so as in places
to become perfectly imperceptible. There is nothing
to be seen in these once delightful plains like cultivation;
all looks a barren waste, as though the inhabitants
had been driven out, or cut off by some
scourge, and the whole country had since been a
place of refuge only for beasts of prey. The mountains
remain untouched for the purposes of cultivation,
except now and then a small patch for the
production of vegetables, and on which is erected a
miserable hut, in no respect superior, in point of accommodation
and comfort, to the wig-wam of the
North American Indians, but in which the sluggish
Haytian will dwindle away his days in laziness, sloth,
and in every species of lust and sensuality. He
seeks for nothing but what supplies his immediate
wants; and so long as he can produce enough for
the calls of to-day, he is careless of what may follow
on the morrow. Sleep and his women occupy the
remainder of his time, with the exception of a brief
interval, which he generally devotes to playing drafts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
or cards with a neighbour, generally as indolent and
as unconcerned as himself. The plains are finely watered;
for independently of La Grande Rivière
there are innumerable smaller streams that water the
different parts, and in the event of any extraordinary
drought, irrigation could be easily resorted to for
the purpose of supporting vegetation. But this is
not often the case, as the seasons appear very regular,
and the country in general is well supplied with
rain from the great attraction of the surrounding
mountainous districts, which are covered with almost
impenetrable underwoods, and the showers
descend into the valleys, and fertilize the soil in an
extraordinary degree.</p>

<p>To the northward of the plains of the Cul de Sac,
in the vicinity of L’Arcahaye, there is nothing to
be seen that in the least indicates a country in that
state of productiveness which is pleasing to the traveller;
every thing exhibits a degree of negligence
that is truly astonishing, particularly when the fertility
of the soil is so well known.</p>

<p>The whole of the extensive and fertile plain of
the Artibanite is in a similar condition; and although
it receives all the beneficial influence derived from
the overflowings of the river of the same name which
washes an extent of fifty leagues, emptying itself into
the bay of St. Marc, still the people do not evince any
disposition to cultivate the land. Scarcely a sugar
plantation is to be seen until you approach Gonaives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
or its vicinity, and those established in that quarter
are not worthy of the designation; they are mere
patches visible on an extended surface, and from the
elevations around them have only the appearance of
detached spots cultivated as gardens. There is nothing
like an extensive scene of cultivation, nor can
such be found throughout the whole of the republic.
In this plain on the coast are situated St. Marc and
Gonaives, which at one period were both places of
considerable trade, and the inhabitants wealthy,
living in great splendour and magnificence; but like
other places inhabited by the blacks and people of
colour, they are neglected, the houses gone to decay,
and allowed to moulder into ruins. Nothing is left
to remind the traveller of what they were. Contrasting
what they are with what they are <i>represented
to have been</i>, he at once infers, that the present
inhabitants are a race devoid of all desire of
improvement, and only raised a very small degree
above the brute creation, from whom in their natures
and habits they differ but little.</p>

<p>The north, taking the whole of the point westward
from Port de Paix to Cape Nicolas Mole,
abounds in fertile plains, and in rich and productive
lands, well watered, and capable of great improvement,
where agriculture might be carried on with
great advantage, and where even an European, in a
climate almost approaching to the temperature of his
native country, might undergo manual labour without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
any more inconvenience from it than what is experienced
by a labourer in Europe in the months
of July and August. This is evident from the
circumstance of a colony of Germans and Dutch
in the neighbourhood of Cape Nicolas Mole having
cultivated their lands unaided by the negroes,
which, in proportion to their extent, are as productive
now as they were at any period of the history
of the country. They do not, it is true, produce
sugar; but in the culture of coffee and cotton
they are exceedingly successful, and are in a
fine thriving condition. These Germans and their
ancestors seem to have resided in this part unmolested
during the whole of the troubles of the revolution
and rebellion; and by the leading chiefs,
subsequent to those events, they have been respected
and protected.</p>

<p>In this district of the island there were several
places of considerable notoriety in the time of the
French, but they are now sunk into disrepute, and
in fact mere villages. These are, the Platform,
the town of Cape Nicolas Mole, Jean Rabel,
and Port de Paix. The Platform was noted in the
time of the revolutionary war with France for being
a place from which a great many privateers were
fitted out for the purpose of menacing our trade
from Jamaica, being within sight of ships passing
to the northward from that island. It is now, however,
of no consideration, as it contains only a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
houses inhabited by fishermen, who, it is said, occasionally
turn pirates, whenever they find a vessel
close enough in shore upon which they can pounce,
without running the risk of being seen by the crew
until they are alongside. The harbour of Cape Nicolas
Mole was the principal place for the safe anchorage
of shipping in the western world, but it has
gone to neglect. The town consists now only of a
few scattered houses of no consideration, and the
whole of the fine fortifications which secured the
harbour against an enemy are now nearly demolished
and tumbling into ruins. The harbour is capable
of holding an immense fleet, and ships of the largest
size may safely ride at anchor, sheltered from the
wind from every quarter. The mountains secure
them against it from the east, north and south, and
the wind from the south-west is greatly shut out by
the high land running westerly.</p>

<p>The water in the harbour and close to the town is
said to be from five to fifteen fathoms deep. In his
negotiations with the Haytian government, the King
of France was exceedingly anxious to have this port
delivered up to him, for the purpose of a place of
security for his fleets, or rather for a footing in the
island, with a view of menacing the Haytians
whenever he felt disposed to threaten them with his
displeasure. But they had sense enough to resist
this demand, and the king was wise enough not to
contend for it, knowing that, in the event of Boyer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
not fulfilling his engagements, it would fall an easy
prey to a very small force that might be sent against
it. The British homeward-bound ships, during the
war with France, were greatly annoyed by privateers
from this port, as they passed within sight of
the Mole, and so near at times, beating to windward,
that it might easily be distinguished whether
they were merchantmen or men-of-war. It was
therefore between the Platform and this port that
most of the captures took place, and lately this
space has been the hiding-place for many piratical
vessels, which run in under the land at daylight,
strike their sails and top-masts, and consequently
lie unperceived during the day, whence they again
sail at night to commit further depredations. This
became so glaring at last, that Boyer was obliged to
send one of his vessels to intercept them; but I do
not hear that he succeeded.</p>

<p>Jean Rabel is an inconsiderable port, with only a
few houses saved during the revolution. The plains
of the same name in its vicinity used to be exceedingly
fertile, but there is now but little done in the
culture of them, and in fact the whole of this part
of the island exhibits a picture of indolence too
shameful for any government to tolerate.</p>

<p>Port de Paix is opposite to the island of Tortuga
at the mouth of the Three Rivers; it is of no magnitude,
not being a port of entry for shipping as it
was formerly; nor is it required, for there is little or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
no traffic, there being but little produce in its neighbourhood.
It was celebrated in the time of the Buccaneers
for being the place of their frequent resort,
after their plundering and marauding voyages in the
adjacent seas. It was here that the celebrated Morgan,
who was afterwards knighted by Charles the
Second, and became lieutenant-governor of Jamaica,
first joined the “Brethren of the Coast”, the term
usually given to the Buccaneers, of whom he finally
became the daring and most famous leader. In the
vicinity of Port de Paix there is a medicinal spring,
the waters of which are strongly sulphuretted, and
are much used and esteemed in cutaneous diseases.</p>

<p>The plains of the north, formerly celebrated for
their sugar plantations, and extending from the
Three Rivers to the old Spanish lines of demarcation,
are in a similar state with every other part
of the country, only partially cultivated in the
elevated parts, with coffee and some cotton. It is
impossible to view these celebrated plains without
regret, and to reflect on the impolitic measures of
the present ruler, which preclude the European all
chance of adventuring with his capital, and trying
what might be accomplished by investing it in the
soil. The most beneficial offer was once made to
him by an American company to colonize a district,
by sending from that country five thousand
blacks, to be emancipated in the event of their being
shipped off from the United States. But he refused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
to accede to the proposal; and what is more, he told
the parties making the application that the American
negroes were too much enlightened to be allowed to
colonize in Hayti, as they might intrigue with the
Haytians to undermine the state. There is no finer
soil in the island for the production of sugar than
is to be found in these plains; it is composed of a
strong black mould, of great depth and exceedingly
rich and nutritive for the cane, and is highly valuable
also for pasturage; but even on this no care or
attention is bestowed, nor are there any pains taken
in the breeding of cattle, for which the whole country
presents the greatest facilities, from the luxuriance
of its grass, and from the whole district being so well
watered by rivers meandering through every part of
it, and by those springs and smaller streams with
which the whole island abounds. No country affords
such retreats from the heat of the solar rays as this.
Nature seems to have dispensed its blessings for
man and beast with a liberal hand; but man here
seems to be but little sensible of the beneficence of
his Creator. All those elegant structures which once
gave the face of these plains and the mountains
around them such an air of grandeur, and excited
the admiration of the traveller, are demolished, and
scarcely a vestige of their original site can be discovered.
Sometimes a dilapidated stonewall, and the
remains of a windmill may point out to the passer-by
that near them once stood an extensive range of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
buildings, and perhaps a mansion of some magnificence.
The highly productive and very extensive
estates once to be seen in the vicinity of La Petite
Ance, St. Acul, Limonde, La Grande Rivière, Le
Dondon, Marmalade, Limbé, and Plaisance, are
now neglected wastes, with little to be seen but the
spreading guava, the wild indigo, and a thousand
other weeds and shrubs, raising themselves unmolested
on the very spots which once displayed all the
luxuriance of vegetation, aided and matured by the
skill and industry of the husbandman.</p>

<p>Christophe certainly made strong efforts to revive
the cultivation of his country, and he made some
progress; but at the period when he was about to
carry into effect a more rigid system for the culture
of the soil, he was cut off, his plans were laid aside
by Boyer, and now, as in every other part of the
country, nothing is seen in that district but desolate
wastes.</p>

<p>The city of Cape Haytien, which is the capital
of the north, retains no vestige of its primitive splendour.
It is, however, a much more pleasant and
more elegant place than Port au Prince, and the inhabitants
are always kind and courteous to strangers,
as they all are in that part of the country which was
under Christophe; a thing which the stranger must
not expect at the seat of government, where the people
are quite the reverse, and all spies. It is situate
at the extremity of a bay, having the sea to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
north, and mountains of considerable elevation on
the south. It is strongly fortified, the old batteries
of the French having been greatly improved by
Christophe, who left nothing undone that could be
accomplished in the way of strengthening his capital.
Towards the sea the ramparts are very commanding,
and an enemy’s vessel would find considerable difficulty
on entering the harbour, as she could only do
so within range of the whole forts, which are well
mounted with guns of large calibre. The only requisite
in the event of war would be men possessing
sufficient skill and courage to man these works and
to defend them. The city is well supplied with
pure water, which descends from the mountains, over
a gravelled surface, and receiving in its course no
stream that can in the least injure its qualities.</p>

<p>A military force of about five thousand men is
kept up in this district, under the command of
General Magny. Part of this force garrisons the
city, in which there are barracks for their residence;
the other part is at different stations on the plains.</p>

<p>The trade to the cape is somewhat circumscribed,
the country round it being not so thickly inhabited
as the south, but what little there is seems to be
carried on with much more regularity, and a great
deal more certainty as to the result, than at Port au
Prince. I have heard it generally remarked that
the people of the north have a greater sense of honour
and rectitude in their commercial dealings with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
foreigners, than the inhabitants of the south. Certain
it is that Christophe in his time exacted from
his people a strict adherence to their word in matters
of commerce, and in the event of a disputed
claim a foreigner had a chance of redress. Not so in
Port au Prince, where, if a foreigner have a demand
against a Haytian, it is ten to one against his getting
any redress, and fifty to one against his getting
paid.</p>

<p>Christophe, who always shewed a very great attention
and respect for the British merchants and
British subjects at the cape, or in any other part of
his dominions, erected a very neat house on an elevation
near the city, and furnished it somewhat
elegantly, in which he had put up billiard tables,
expressly as a place of resort for them, and of the
whole he made them a present, with his pledge
that no person of the country should be permitted to
disturb them, nor should the premises be used by
his people at any time or for any purposes.</p>

<p>At no great distance from the city of Cape Haytien
were those two stupendous works of Christophe,
his palace of Sans Souci and the Citadel Henry, or
Fort Ferrier, the construction of which shews no little
labour and design, and the expense of their erection
must have exceeded any thing that can be imagined
as the cost of modern works. I cannot describe them
better than by quoting the account given of them by
a native of Hayti, in his narrative of Christophe’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
elevation to the throne. “The Citadel Henry,” he
says, “that palladium of liberty, that majestic bulwark
of independence, that monument of the greatness,
and of the vast combinations of a Henry, is
built on the lofty summit of one of the highest mountains
in the island, whence you may discover to
the left the island of Tortuga, and the reflection
of its beautiful canal; in front, the gentle risings,
with the city of Cape Henry, its roadstead, and the
vast expanse of the ocean; on the right, La Grange,
Monte Christi, the city of Fort Royal, Mancheneel
Bay, and the surrounding hills. The eye is gratified
with the prospect of the beautiful plain, and
the magnificent carpet of verdure spread before it.
At the back, the extended chain of mountains seems
as it were the frame to this enchanting picture.
The position fortified by nature, and to which art
has added all its science, with casemates and bomb
proofs, has secured it from being successfully besieged,
while the mouths of cannon overtop the elevation
of the high ground, and command the adjacent
territory, affording protection to the whole
north, and indeed to Hayti itself, this being the
most formidable defence it possesses.”<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>On the subject of this fort, I have before stated
that it was built under the directions of an individual
said to have been a Scotchman, of the name of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
Ferrier, from whom it takes the appellation of Fort
Ferrier.</p>

<p>Of the magnificence of the palace of Sans Souci,
I shall give the description of Saunders, as conveying
an idea of what it was. “Sans Souci, a town
rising into preference, and likely to become the capital
of Hayti, has been established. Ravines have
been filled up, mountains levelled, and public roads
laid out. This superb royal palace, the glory of
Hayti, is carried up to a great elevation. The beauty
and durability of its construction, its sumptuous
apartments, all with inlaid work, and lined with the
most beautiful and rarest tapestry, which was amassed
at a great expense, and with particular care in the
selection; the furniture and elegant tapestry, selected
with good taste; the gardens arranged with
a just symmetry, through which meanders a pure
stream, having a degree of freshness that particularly
characterizes it, the jets d’eau, the fruit trees,
and European productions, &amp;c. &amp;c., combine to embellish
the retreat of a hero, and to attract the admiration
of strangers; whilst a church, whose noble
dome agreeably points out the richness of its architecture,
and other public establishments, such as
arsenals, dock-yards, and barracks, have sprung up
around in spite of the ravages of war. To see the
astonishing activity diffused in all these works, one
would say that the greatest tranquillity had prevailed,
and that it was the hand of peace which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
brought them to perfection! Immense treasures, the
fruits of economy in the public administration of
finances, fill the spacious coffers of the Citadel
Henry.” “I know it”, he says again, “to be one
of the intentions of our king to have the rotunda of
his palace in the citadel paved and lined with quadruples.
He is rich enough to do this.”</p>

<p>The palace of Sans Souci was certainly (from the
accounts given of it by many individuals now in
Hayti, and who have often been admitted to the
levées of King Christophe) upon a most magnificent
scale; and in elegance of structure, as well as
the durability of its materials, but little, if at all
inferior to some of the most admired edifices of
Europe. Christophe was lavish of his money in the
building of this palace as well as the citadel, and
whilst they were being erected, he acted with great
severity towards his people, whom he compelled to
carry the materials to the spot, neither age nor sex,
except the decrepit and the very young, being spared.</p>

<p>Christophe was once visited in this palace by an
officer of the British navy, and a relative of a right
honourable gentleman high in his Majesty’s councils,
to whom he shewed great attention and courtesy,
and expressed great satisfaction at being honoured
with the calls of British subjects who occasionally
touched at the cape. In a conversation
with this distinguished officer on the subject of this
stupendous palace, he said, “that his intentions were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
to ornament the walls with gold, and that the floors
should be laid with silver, that the ambassadors of
the world, should any be sent to him, might see how
splendidly a western monarch could live.”</p>

<p>Fort Ferrier can be easily seen from the sea, and
ships outward-bound for any of the western ports,
sailing along the north side of the island, have
a good view of it from its amazing elevation, the
stone of which it is built being so very white as to
make it a most excellent land-mark. The palace
however cannot be discerned, and since the death
of Christophe, it has been mostly destroyed, nothing
but the walls being left. All the beautiful carved-work
wainscoting has been taken from it, the mahogany
floor torn up, and the whole burnt by the
people; and nothing remains except the outworks,
which are converted into apartments for the military
who are stationed there.</p>

<p>Beyond the Massacre, in the old Spanish territory,
and on the banks of the Yague, the country is
exceedingly productive, but quite neglected. It is
only a few years since that a very considerable trade
was carried on between Jamaica and Monte Christi,
and Puerto de Plata; the produce of those fine valleys
on each bank of the river, as well as of the
fertile plains of La Vega Real, always found a ready
market in the different ports of that island. Tobacco,
rice, Indian corn, beans and peas, peculiar to
the West Indies, and in great request as food for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
negroes, were exported in large quantities, as were
also horned cattle, mahogany, dye-wood, and often
poultry. In return, the people took rum, salted
provisions, ironmongery, cotton goods of a coarse
quality, blue Yorkshire baize, Osnaburgs, and a variety
of other articles required for the labourers in
wood-cutting and agriculture. The annexation of
the Spanish part to the republic stopped this intercourse,
and consequently the finest vent for the disposing
of the produce of their industry became shut,
and having no other intercourse, the demand has entirely
ceased. There is no encouragement therefore
left for husbandry, and all those lands which were
before appropriated exclusively to the raising of the
several articles which I have before enumerated, are
now uncultivated, with the exception of mere patches
where vegetables are raised for the immediate wants
of the people.</p>

<p>The town of Monte Christi is a place of little
resort, its trade having been ruined by the restrictive
laws in force in the West Indies. It stands at the
extremity of the promontory on the north branch of
the Yague. Occasionally American vessels call in,
and barter their provisions for mahogany and dye-woods,
and sometimes take tobacco, the quality of
which is much finer and milder than that of the
United States. Contiguous to the river, and particularly
on its southern bank, the country abounds
with mahogany and dye-woods, and in the mountains,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
mines were said to exist, containing gold and silver
and other valuable ore. But very recently a company
formed in London for the purpose of exploring
them, found that the undertaking would be attended
with a considerable waste of capital, without the
possibility of obtaining returns likely to compensate
the outlay of the experiment. There is great reason
to doubt the representations that were made by
the Haytian government on the subject of these
mines, when they appeared so anxious to have them
worked; their sanguine assurances of ultimate success
were only intended to delude, as they could
not seriously expect that any beneficial result would
attend these operations.</p>

<p>To the eastward, beyond the town of Santiago,
are the plains of La Vega Real, celebrated for their
extreme verdure and fertility. They are in a great
measure inclosed by the surrounding hills, which
form an appearance not unlike an amphitheatre.
These plains are capable of producing, were they
properly tilled, every description of tropical plants,
and in the elevated parts there is every reason to
believe that European grain might easily be raised.
The temperature of this district makes it a most
congenial spot for all sorts of agricultural labour,
and the culture of the soil would be rewarded with
an ample harvest. The whole of the plains are well
watered by innumerable small streams, which, flowing
from different parts of the mountains, empty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
themselves into the Yuna. This river, in its course
to the bay of Sumana, is exceedingly convenient for
the wood-cutters who float their mahogany and dye-woods
down it into the bay, for the purpose of sale
and shipping.</p>

<p>Sumana, which appears as if it were detached
from the main land, is a peninsula, and may be said
to be nearly uninhabited. A few American free
persons of colour have emigrated thither from the
United States, for the purpose of cultivation; but
they have greatly diminished since their arrival,
numbers clandestinely leaving it, finding that the
assurances held out to them by the Haytian government
were only made for the purpose of deluding
them to form a settlement. It is a low and swampy
situation, and not likely to be an eligible place for
colonization, as fevers and agues are exceedingly
prevalent. Notwithstanding all these unfavourable
consequences, Bonaparte planned a new city about
the middle of the peninsula, to be called Napoleon;
for this purpose, I am inclined to think that a survey
was taken, but the design was finally given up. The
bay of Sumana is very capacious, and affords a most
delightful anchorage for shipping; and it may be
justly denominated the key to the Mona Passage,
as all ships passing from the north through the passage
must be perceived by the vessels at anchor in
the bay.</p>

<p>There is nothing remarkable in the south-east<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
end of the island from the city of Santo Domingo to
Higuey, with the exception of the extensive plains
of Los Llanos, through which the traveller passes
to Scibo, and thence to Higuey. These plains
have been well described by Mr. Walton in his
history of the Spanish colonies, and at the period
of his residence in the island, they were without
doubt the most delightful pastures in the western
world. That writer says, “these astonishing plains
constitute almost a sixth of the island, extending
nearly to the east end, a distance of more than
ninety miles, on a width of about thirty. On them
cattle of more than a hundred owners pasture in
herds, and are collected, counted, and the young
branded at the season when the calf cannot mistake
its mother. The dexterity with which the herdsman
on horseback with a lance in his hand separates
one of his master’s brand from the rest, is wonderful.
In the dry season when the blade is long and
rank, it is customary to burn all the grass on the
plains, which serves as an annual manure; for in
that season the cattle generally take to the forests in
search of the herbage which the sun has not had the
power to parch. The operation of burning is performed
by setting fire to the most eastern part of
the tract, whence the wind regularly blows; it
spreads in long and succeeding volumes, frequently
making the traveller recede, and effacing the path
through which he has been accustomed to journey.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>”
Subsequently to the repossession of the eastern part
by the Spaniards on the expulsion of the French by
General Carmichael, a very extensive trade in cattle
was carried on with the island of Jamaica, which
continued until the union with the west, when the
intercourse was restricted, and, consequently, the
breeding of cattle has not been so much attended
to as formerly, as they have only their internal
consumption to take them off. Many are now killed
for the skin and tallow; when the meat is jerked,
and the Spaniards from the continent of South
America purchase it and ship it to the Havanna,
where it is in great request for the slaves, and is
called Tassaja.</p>

<p>The town of Higuey was once of some note from
the riches and magnificence of its church, which
it appears escaped the ravages of the revolution,
and was not visited by those sacrilegious wretches,
who devoted all edifices to destruction that had
once been the resort of the white inhabitants of the
island. The people formerly used to go on a pilgrimage
to the shrine of the Virgin in this church from
all parts of the island; but a few only now undertake
it. The Virgin therefore has become poor, and
the monks who used to officiate are reduced to great
shifts for an existence. I know not if this be a
mark of improvement in the Haytians; at all events,
there seems to be less superstition and bigotry: a
little, however, is still left amongst the females. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
knew one instance of a female at Port au Prince
who undertook a pilgrimage to the shrine of the
virgin. She went by water to the city of Santo
Domingo; and on her voyage thither was in great
danger of being lost; but far from being alarmed,
she considered it as part of the penance she had to
perform before she invoked the saint for a remission
of her sins, and therefore exulted at her good
luck in meeting with such a disaster on her way.</p>

<p>The city of Santo Domingo, being, I believe, the
oldest city in the republic, has been described by
Walton as having been exceedingly strong, regularly
built, and well fortified, and as containing
many public edifices of note. Having since his time
gone greatly into decay, it has declined in consequence,
as well as in its commercial character; and
it is remarkable, that in every place in which
Haytian influence predominates, commercial enterprise,
and every other good quality appertaining to
man, is sure to sink to the lowest ebb. This may
appear extraordinary, but it is true, and the city of
Santo Domingo is an example of what I now write;
for at this moment it certainly is in a state of inconceivable
misery, and the greatest poverty and
wretchedness prevail amongst the people. No
place in the republic is better situated for commerce,
were the people and the government disposed
to encourage it; but no such disposition is
manifested by either: and those merchants, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
formerly had extensive dealings with the Spanish
Main, have thought it adviseable to leave it and take
up their abode in a country where they are likely
to receive some encouragement, and may be able to
invest their capital, with some chance of receiving
an equivalent return for their industry.</p>

<p>The city is nearly a mile in circumference, and
at this time does not contain above fourteen thousand
inhabitants, although in the time of the
Spaniards, including its attached district, it contained
twenty-two thousand, and yet the population
is said by the government to have increased exceedingly.</p>

<p>The harbour of Santo Domingo is a very indifferent
one, being too much exposed to the south
winds, but the ground is good for holding. It was
in this harbour that Admiral Sir John Duckworth
defeated a French squadron in the beginning of
1806. They were at anchor nearly under the walls
of the city, from the batteries of which they received
some protection; but the British were not
to be intimidated. Putting every obstacle at defiance,
they boldly entered, attacked the French line in
succession, and obtained a decisive victory, taking
and destroying the greatest part.</p>

<p>The river Ozama, which washes the eastern side
of the city, is a strong and wide stream, and is of
great advantage to it, as it not only carries off a
great deal of the decayed animal and vegetable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
matter that is at times to be found in the vicinity,
but offers great facilities for floating down timber
and for carrying provisions and produce from the
interior of the country.</p>

<p>To the westward of the city of Santo Domingo
as far as Jacmel, the whole country is very little inhabited,
although it is most beautifully picturesque,
and affords every encouragement to the cultivator
from the extreme richness of its soil. The bay of Ocoa
has several convenient anchorages for shipping, and
it is here that the largest quantity of mahogany and
dye-woods is shipped for Europe and the United
States; and formerly cattle were purchased, of
which the supply was extensive and the prices exceedingly
cheap. The Neyva, a river which has
its source in the mountains of Cibao, and runs
through a very rich and delightfully romantic district,
emptying itself into a bay of the same name,
receives vessels of small draught of water, for the
purpose of conveying the products of the country
on its banks to Jacmel for a market. In the
neighbourhood of the banks of the Neyva are many
remains of sugar settlements. This district is well
watered, and occasionally shaded from the power
of the sun; and as the soil is strong, it must have
been highly productive in sugar as well as congenial
for the breeding of cattle: nothing can exceed
its verdure, and its fertility is generally admitted.
The palmetto, or mountain-cabbage, grows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
in this district in a most flourishing state, demonstrating
the richness of the soil, as this vegetable
will not arrive at very high perfection except in
tracts of country where the soil possesses great
nutritive powers as well as a moderate degree of
moisture.</p>

<p>From the Neyva to the west of the peninsula at
Cape Tiburon the only places now of any trade or
of the least note, are Jacmel and Aux Cayes. Jacmel
was formerly a place of great trade from its
situation, being so immediately convenient for carrying
on an intercourse with the Spanish ports of the
island, and likewise with the Spanish ports in South
America; it had also a communication with Jamaica,
which was valuable to it, but the restriction annihilated
this branch of its commerce; and as the intercourse
with South America subsided when the revolution
in that country commenced, it lost its commerce
altogether, and it is now a poor inconsiderable
place, without trade, and without inhabitants
of any respectability or means. The vicinity of
Jacmel was never much celebrated for the extent of
its cultivation, though in proportion to its means
the returns to the cultivator seemed to meet his expectations.
Sugar and coffee were the principal
articles of growth; some cotton and a small proportion
of indigo were also produced. Scarcely any
thing is now produced except coffee, and but little
of that commodity. The intermediate places to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
Aux Cayes are now nearly neglected, Aquin being
the only one now frequented; and there are only a
few inhabitants, such as fishermen, who carry on a
kind of contraband trade in coffee to avoid the export
duty, which can be done in these quarters
easily enough, the officers of the customs being so
ill paid by the government, that they are necessitated
to make up the deficiency by participating in
the profit of defrauding the revenue over which they
are placed as guardians.</p>

<p>Aux Cayes is a place of some trade and a port
from which is shipped a large portion of the produce
of this part of the country. In the neighbourhood
of Aux Cayes the soil is exceedingly productive,
and to the cultivator used to return as
much as any other part of the island, requiring at
the same time less labour and less means; but now,
however, like its adjoining districts, it has gone into
great neglect, and exhibits on the face of it that relaxation
in the culture which is so general throughout
the republic. Indeed in the whole of this part
the sugar cane is but little planted; in fact, with the
exception of an instance or two in which English
gentlemen happen to hold property in trust, the cane
plantations are but little attended to; they are allowed
to go on years in succession without cleaning,
without manure, or any other requisite to render
them productive. There are several British houses
in Aux Cayes who used to carry on an extensive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
trade with the interior, and with the Spanish Main
and Jamaica, but they have sustained considerable
losses by the Haytians; and the restriction precluding
an intercourse with other islands, they have
only the chance of adventuring to the South American
ports, and this only has been permitted recently
by an act of the legislative body; for of late
years goods exported received no drawback, but
were subjected to the full duties, unless they were
exported within six months, when they only paid
half duties, or six per cent. But even this permission
cannot benefit the merchant here, the trade
direct to the Spanish Main supplying that market
so abundantly, that the chance of an advantageous
speculation is but very doubtful.</p>

<p>The whole of this vicinity and the district southward
of the mountains of La Hotte, may be said to
present the finest field for agricultural operations.
A rich and nutritive soil, a congenial climate, and
fine, refreshing, and seasonable rains, with a plentiful
supply of water, all cooperating, hold out to the cultivator
the greatest encouragement to exert his skill
and industry, and to avail himself of those gifts which
the hand of Providence has so liberally dispensed.
But in the Haytian no such energy must be expected;
nothing requiring the least effort of the mind or
exertion of the body will rouse the energy of that
slothful and inactive being, who idles away his time,
careless of the consequences that may spring from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
his negligence and his irresistible desire for repose
and quietude. In fact, I fear that nothing can be
done that can prove effectual in stimulating the
Haytian; it would be a task of no little labour to
lead him; to drive him, would perhaps endanger the
state.</p>

<p>From Aux Cayes through the country by Cape
Tiburon to Jeremie, cultivation appears generally
in a very backward state. The passing traveller
sees nothing to attract him, except now and then an
object which reminds him that the vicinity was
once the scene of great havoc and desolation, and
that all that was valuable and useful had been destroyed
by some general convulsion. The remains
of habitations, remnants of walls, and scattered implements
of tropical labour, are to be seen in all
directions. Here an iron boiler, half buried in the
surface; there an old iron shaft of a mill, or some
other part of the apparatus for the manufacture of
sugar, and often a dismounted cannon, arrest the
attention of the traveller as the wretched memorials
of a devastating war.</p>

<p>In the district of Jeremie, which produced at one
period large crops of coffee, cocoa, indigo, and cotton,
but few symptoms of agricultural industry are
visible. The finest plantations of the French are
now totally obscured and overspread with the creeper,
the windband, and numberless other species of indigenous
weeds. In vain does the traveller look for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
those settlements which wore the gay appearance of
culture, and for those plantations that enriched the
proprietors, and placed them in that ease and affluence
to which their industry and their perseverance
so justly entitled them. Instead of such a scene,
the whole country, as we approach towards the capital,
exhibits nothing but neglect and waste, and
their concomitants, poverty and wretchedness.</p>

<p>The plains Leogane, which once excited the admiration
of travellers, and formed the scene of so
much contention during the heat of the rebellion, are
partially cultivated, and on the elevations that surround
them a patch is in some places selected by a settler
for the raising of vegetables for his own consumption;
but I could perceive nothing which indicated a
regular scene of cultivation, or which had the appearance
of a system of agriculture likely to be beneficial
to the proprietor of the soil. This state of things
appears however not confined to a particular district;
there is a similarity of negligence throughout the
whole of the republic, and it would be an invidious
distinction to select one part as worse than another.</p>

<p>Nothing can be more laborious, nor more inconvenient
and unpleasant, than travelling in Hayti,
from the state of the roads, from the want of inns
for accommodation, and from the innumerable rivers
and streams over which the traveller has to pass,
and which, at all seasons, he is obliged to ford, often
swimming his horse, and exposed to great danger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
from the rapidity and force of the current (to say
nothing of being nearly up to his shoulders in
water). There are no bridges in the island; the Haytians
being all good swimmers, and much addicted
to ablutions, deem them unnecessary. In the time
of the French, the roads through the whole of their
division were admirable; indeed they were admitted
to be the best in the West Indies; the materials
being adjacent to them, and the expense of putting
them on the required parts so very trifling, they were
always kept in the most perfect order, and carriages
of all descriptions could pass with the same facility
as in any country in Europe, from one extremity of
the colony to the other. The accommodations for
strangers too were of the first order, and no inconvenience
was experienced for the want of those comforts
so requisite after a journey under a tropical sun.
But the scene is quite changed. It is almost impossible
to describe the state of the roads at this
moment. It is evident that, notwithstanding the
heavy contributions levied for their repair, they have
remained untouched since the revolution, and there
seems a disposition on the part of the government to
efface every vestige of the former roads, leaving the
people who travel to beat out their own way in the
most easy manner they can. On approaching the
capital, they are, it is true, somewhat better than in
the interior. Here a little attention is bestowed
upon them, whilst in other districts they are unnoticed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
All the criminals sentenced to labour on the
roads are employed in the vicinity of Port au
Prince; and this seems to be a measure suggested
from its being economical, as the criminals have an
opportunity of supporting themselves by begging.</p>

<p>It may not be amiss to explain in this part how
the criminals are treated in the republic, and to shew
what nice feelings the government has with regard
to their treatment during the hours of labour, and
the way in which they are provided for. All criminals
who are sentenced to work on the public roads
for a stated time, are not <i>chained</i> together, but
<i>roped together by pairs</i>, the rope being first attached
to the neck, then descending to the body, where it
is fastened; the ends of the ropes are joined, so as
to leave the space of about three yards between the
criminals thus tied together. They labour from
daylight until sun-set, being allowed an interval of
about an hour and a half for dinner at noon. The
government pretends to provide for them; but to
save the expense of provisions, two of these criminals,
accompanied by two soldiers with their bayonets
fixed, are permitted to go about to beg provisions
for the subsistence of the whole, and unless they
chance to be very successful, they get but a very
poor allowance, and often are left to fast until the
next day. They are in gangs of about fifteen or
twenty, and over every gang nearly as many soldiers,
and an officer, all armed, are placed to force them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
to labour. At night they are incarcerated in the
gaol, and their bed is composed simply of boards
without any covering; they are allowed no supper.
Admitting their criminality to be great, and their
punishment just, still such a system has a degree of
barbarity in it which can never prevail except among
savage nations. What! convicted felons sentenced
to hard labour, and directed to beg for their subsistence
at the point of the bayonet! It seems incredible.
The thing is too revolting to be admitted,
many will say; but I declare it to be a fact, and call
upon the people of Hayti to contradict it if they can.
It is the labour of these criminals which alone renders
the roads approaching the city somewhat passable.</p>

<p>From Jacmel to the capital, the road is in the
worst state, and it is evident that it has not undergone
any repair since the revolution. It is almost
impassable in places, and never receives the least
attention from one end of the year to the other. If
the roads were in a condition to offer the least encouragement
to travellers, I cannot imagine a more
romantic nor a more enchanting ride. Ascending
the lofty mountain of Tavite, the scenery is beautiful.
To the southward is seen the Carribean sea,
with Jacmel and its plain immediately below; on
the other side may be viewed the island of Gonaives,
the bay of Port au Prince, with the town of Leogane
and its extensive plains. In every direction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
also are to be seen small cordilleras intersecting,
between which are valleys whose verdure is perennial,
and having natural pastures of the most luxuriant
growth, which are seldom visited by the husbandman,
and remain untouched by beast.</p>

<p>From the capital to the extremity of the western
peninsula and Aux Cayes, the roads are very bad.
To the latter place a chaise may penetrate by way
of Leogane, Petit Goane, Morogane, and Aquin;
few persons however who are accustomed to travel
between the two places would venture to drive, but
would rather ride, as the safest mode of travelling.
Going to the north from Port au Prince, the old
road remains, but in such a state as to be in places
almost impassable. When the country was in cultivation,
and these roads were in their finest order,
a tour through the northern departments of the
country must have afforded the traveller much gratification.</p>

<p>From Gonaives to Cape Haytien, the road is
somewhat more easy for travellers, and in fact,
throughout the whole of Christophe’s country, they
are infinitely better than in the south, for he attended
to their repairs, and saw that they were kept in good
condition. The Escalier, about half way between
the two places, deserves the notice of strangers, and
perhaps is the most extraordinary road in the western
world, with the exception of some that are to
be met with in Columbia and in Mexico. No name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
could be more appropriate, for it certainly has the
appearance of a staircase. This road ascends very
high, and the precipices on its side are enough to
intimidate the boldest rider who attempts to ascend
or descend it.</p>

<p>Through the whole of the republic I believe there
is not a decent inn for the accommodation of travellers;
at all events, I never had the good fortune to
find one, nor did I hear of one in any direction.
There are huts on the road side, into which those
who are travelling sometimes go to obtain lodging
for the night; but even in these, a bed would not
be easily found, and instead of a pallet, some boards
thrown on the floor must suffice to repose on. On
the summit of the mountains of Tavite, there is a
hut of this description, and on passing that road on
one occasion I was benighted, and took up my abode
there until morning. A bed I was unable to obtain,
there being only one in the house, and that was
taken up by a Frenchman who had arrived a little
before me. Mine hostess of the mountain, however,
being a good-natured sable creature, was kind enough
to prepare a place on which I might recline during
my stay. Whilst she was engaged in adjusting my
apartment, I thought it a measure of necessity to
prepare myself for it by a copious libation of brandy,
as a somniferous cordial; a great requisite in these
Haytian inns, as one is sometimes rather disturbed
by an insect that is very common in them, and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
which it is not an easy matter for a man to disencumber
himself, as they evince an extraordinary pertinacity
in adhering to the body, and excite a sensation
not at all calculated to invite sleep. Having fortified
myself against the offensive operations of my dreaded
enemy, I prepared to enter my apartment, but this
was attended with some difficulty, its dimensions
being only sufficient for a dwarf, and not calculated
for a person somewhat beyond the middle size. I
was obliged therefore to resort to the plan usually
adopted on board of small vessels, by putting my
head in first, and then by degrees to get in my body
and legs; and this place about four feet square, on
boards covered with my cloak, being one of those
apartments of the inn usually appropriated for strangers,
became my lodging for the night. To sleep
was impossible, for the bugs, rats, and croaking
lizards, haunted me the whole night, and I rose
again before daylight just as fatigued as when I
arrived the evening before, and with the additional
knowledge of having a dollar to pay for my <i>bed</i>.
The houses of the negroes in the British colonies
are a palace compared with this <i>inn for travellers</i>;
and yet this is one of the most frequented places in
the republic.</p>

<p>In most parts of the West Indies there are public
places to which people frequently resort for amusement
on holidays, but there is no such thing in
Hayti, except when parties occasionally go from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
Port au Prince to the lakes of the Cul de Sac, but
even this is attended with great inconvenience,
there being no places for the reception of travellers;
and persons are therefore obliged to seek and beg
temporary accommodations of the people in their
vicinity, from whom at times you do not receive
much civility, and they exact enormously for every
thing you purchase. Were there any place fit for
the reception of people, a tour to the lakes is worth
undertaking, though the roads to them, like all the
rest, are execrable. The largest of these lakes is
named La Laguna de Henriquillo, and is about
fifty miles in circumference, situate to the eastward
of the old line of demarcation, and about thirty
miles from the sea at the mouth of the Rio de Pedernales.
Its water is salt, and although at this
distance from the coast, there is the same motion in
its waters as in the neighbouring ocean. The country
on its banks is exceedingly attractive and highly
picturesque, and exhibits a scene of natural fertility
and beauty scarcely to be equalled in any other part
of the Antilles. The game peculiar to the country
is very abundant in this district, and the inhabitants
who reside near the lakes subsist solely upon it and
the fish which they can obtain in great abundance.</p>

<p>The smaller lake, called Etang du Cul de Sac,
contains fresh water, and the fish in it are very
numerous. The soil in the vicinity of these lakes
is the deepest and richest mould, and not having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
for years been disturbed for tillage, has become
highly nutritive, from the animal and vegetable
matter which decays annually upon its surface.</p>

<p>The value of land throughout the republic is
greatly deteriorated, from the impossibility of making
a money value from it within any moderate time.
Labour being so high, and the difficulty of finding
labourers for cultivation so very great, that the lands
in the possession of the government lie in an untilled
state, without any person evincing the slightest
disposition to purchase them. Land also in the possession
of individuals is similarly circumstanced;
and those who are large proprietors cannot effect a
sale of any produce which they may have beyond
the quantity which they can consume; consequently
a proprietor may have an immense extent of land,
and yet be quite unable to derive any benefit
from it by cultivation, or to convert it into money,
for the want of purchasers. Thus, as I have before
stated, there is no individual wealth in the country,
because, although a man may have very large landed
possessions, still those possessions are unavailable,
for they produce him nothing, as he can seldom find
persons disposed either to occupy or purchase them.
There are some instances of proprietors leasing
their lands to persons who undertake to cultivate
them, for which they receive about one-third of
the produce; but this is far from being general,
and I imagine can only be accomplished by military<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
men who have the command of troops, and who are
thereby enabled to till them by working parties daily
sent out for that purpose.</p>

<p>The finest land in the republic would not sell for
more than sixty dollars per acre, although contiguous
to a port for shipping, and of a quality so strong
and nutritive, as to be capable of growing any of the
tropical productions. The mountain-lands, and the
lighter descriptions in the plains, suitable for cocoa
and cotton, can be obtained for a price varying between
twenty and thirty dollars in any quantity from
ten to five hundred acres. In the plains of the Artibanite,
where the soil is exceedingly rich and fertilized
by the overflowings of that river in the
months of May and November, and which has been
yearly improving its condition, from having been
upwards of thirty years out of cultivation, I have
known small plots of land, for horticultural purposes,
sold for forty dollars per acre. In those districts
where indigo and cotton were formerly most generally
planted, for the growth of which the soil is suitable,
the situation peculiarly adapted, and the climate and
seasons congenial, the price of land seldom exceeds
thirty dollars per acre. I know an instance of a sale
of land, once an old cotton plantation, which only
brought twenty dollars per acre for one part, and
about twelve for another.</p>

<p>In the northern department, about Limonde and
La Grande Rivière, land is exceedingly low, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
notwithstanding its high repute for all the purposes
of cultivation, it seldom exceeds forty or forty-five
dollars per acre, and even at those prices it is difficult
to find purchasers, except for mere plots to be
occupied in raising vegetables. The finest pasture-lands,
having all the advantages of shade and water,
and in all the luxuriance of vegetation, can scarcely
find purchasers, and will not bring above forty dollars
per acre. With respect to lands on the coast
they are generally in waste, unless they happen to
be immediately in the vicinity of a town, when some
of them are occupied as small settlements for vegetables
and for raising poultry for the markets: but
there are no extensive plantations of sugar or coffee
situate very near the sea, although formerly the
whole coast was in cultivation as far as it was practicable
to extend it.</p>

<p>In the plains of Cul de Sac, in the neighbourhood
of La Croix des Bouquets, the land is a little occupied,
but in possession of individuals who have held
it since the distribution in the time of Toussaint and
Dessalines; and although in this part of the country
the soil is exceedingly deep and strong, land hardly
finds purchasers. Land again in the mountains
varies in price according to its situation. In those
valleys surrounded by the cordilleras that are so numerous
in the country, and in which the verdure is
constant, which are finely watered, and have a delightful
temperature through the year, the land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
sometimes brings fifty dollars per acre, whilst tracts
exposed to the north and north-easterly winds, and
having rapid descents, are seldom worth purchasing,
and few people buy them; they are generally given
by the government to superannuated soldiers, who
are allowed to leave the army and turn cultivators.
Land in the towns and cities is sold at moderate
prices, much lower than might be imagined. A lot,
containing a frontage of sixty feet, with a depth of
forty or fifty feet, eligibly situate for the purposes
of trade, may be bought in Port au Prince for about
two hundred dollars. This may seem surprising to
persons unacquainted with the country, and who
have been led to believe that Hayti is in a most
flourishing state; but it is true, and at once shews
that poverty is generally prevalent, and that there
is no security for property in whatever commodity
it may be vested. Houses and land are a very insecure
tenure under such a government as that
which at present exists in Hayti, and whilst such a
constitution endures, and such inefficient persons
are permitted to command, but little improvement
can be expected, and the value of property, instead
of increasing, will certainly decline.</p>

<p class="pn2"><span class="smcap">I shall</span> now endeavour to detail the decline of
agriculture in Hayti, and to offer a few remarks
upon its present state; as well as to shew that under
the present inefficient government, very faint hopes
only can be held out of any revival, or that the
republic of Hayti can ever reach that eminence and
repute which once belonged to Saint Domingo as a
French colony.</p>

<p>In various parts of this work I have observed that
the decline of agriculture commenced immediately
after the improvident and impolitic measures pursued
by the national assembly of France, and after
the first partial revolt of the slave population: and
that all the energy of the successive chiefs who have
subsequently governed the country, and who have
promulgated several edicts to enforce or encourage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
cultivation, has not been sufficiently powerful to
keep up that regular system of tillage from which,
in her former state, she derived such advantages.
True it is, that great efforts were made by Toussaint,
Dessalines, and Christophe, to infuse into the
people a taste for husbandry, and to impress on
them that the surest way to arrive at affluence is by
an undeviating perseverance in the cultivation of
those lands which had fallen into their possession;
that the only true riches of a country are to be derived
from the soil; and that commerce, although a
very powerful auxiliary, is only a secondary means
by which a nation can arrive at opulence, or its
people attain to any advancement in wealth. But
their efforts were unavailing in part, though they
certainly did more to keep up cultivation than has
been attempted since their days. The proclamation
of Toussaint in the year 1800 was a powerful document,
and had a great effect as an incitement to
labour; and his solicitude respecting an intercourse
with Europe and the United States shewed that he
wished to adopt every expedient by which encouragement
could be given to the cultivator; to find a
vent for their productions, in order to enhance their
value, and thus stimulate the occupiers of the soil
to further exertions. He was extremely solicitous to
introduce an organized system of cultivation which
would eventually aggrandize his country. Coercion
he knew to be absolutely necessary. He was well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
aware that without this nothing could be accomplished.
But the state of popular feeling rendered
the rigid exaction of duty in agricultural labour a
dangerous experiment; he therefore decided on
adopting a mean between two extremes which,
while it excited no dissatisfaction among the people,
would provide for the exigences of his government.</p>

<p>Toussaint unquestionably pursued a plan which,
had he not been seized by the French general, and
in defiance of the laws of honour and nations so inhumanly
transported to France, would in time have
so far restored agriculture, and placed his country
in so flourishing a condition, that in a few years it
would have rivalled even the most happy period of
its agricultural and commercial greatness. His object
was clearly to advance by degrees, and to
stimulate his people to the culture of the soil, by
holding it up as the most noble pursuit of which they
could possibly make choice; to infuse into them a
taste for industry; and to give them a relish for
those rural occupations which cultivation required,
and for which, the extremely rich and fertile soil of
the country would so amply and so quickly reward
them. He had also made great strides towards impressing
them with an idea that they had many
wants, which, although artificial, yet were necessary
towards advancing them in the opinion of the world.
To teach them this effectually, and to impress it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
seriously, would have been a work of time, but he
made great efforts, and he began to perceive that
they had not been unavailing. But wherever he
discovered an invincible indisposition to receive
these salutary lessons and a total disregard of his
admonitions and persuasions, he tried what force
would accomplish; and consequently the law for
enforcing agriculture was enacted, and all people
were directed to make choice of the plantations on
which they were disposed to labour, prohibiting all
persons from living in idleness and sloth. The estate
and the employer being thus once selected, the
labourer was not permitted to recall his choice, unless
permission to do this were granted him by the
officer commanding the district or one of the municipal
authorities. Hence the labourers became once
more slaves in fact, although not so in name.</p>

<p>When this law was promulgated, Toussaint began
to exert the power which he possessed to enforce it,
and cultivation began to raise its head in a most
eminent degree. The sugar estates exhibited labour
going on with the same spirit and success as
in former times; the coffee settlements displayed a
busy scene in every direction throughout the colony;
and the cotton and cocoa plantations shewed that
they were not to be neglected in the midst of this
animated and interesting struggle for the revival of
a country’s greatness and a nation’s wealth. But
here coercion did the work, here was compulsory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
labour resorted to, because it was sanctioned by the
law, and those who held the power were more than
equal to those who felt a disposition to resist it.
The whip, that symbol of office of the principal
negro, was dispensed with, it is true, but the cultivators
were placed under the apprehension of a more
effective weapon, for they were attended through
the day by a military guard, and the bayonet and
the sabre superseded the cat and the lash. To the
astonishment of the leading people in the country,
the cultivators submitted to this coercion without a
murmur; and it was not until French intrigue was
industriously set to work to instil into their minds
that their condition was worse than when they were
slaves, that any disposition was shewn to oppose
the principle of compulsory labour; and even this
opposition was far from being general. When we
take into consideration that the population under
Toussaint had greatly diminished, and that the
cultivators in his time exceeded very little more
than half of the slaves that were employed in agriculture
in the time of the French, and compare the
returns of produce at the respective periods, it must
be evident that the system of coercion resorted to
by Toussaint, must have been to the full as rigid
as that which existed at any former period, or it
would have been impossible for him to have carried
on cultivation to so great an extent.</p>

<p>In the early part of this work I have stated the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
quantity of produce exported in the year 1791,
which was the most flourishing period of the French,
and the number of slaves that were employed in the
colony. That the reader may more clearly see the
difference at the two periods, I shall enumerate the
principal articles again. It appears by various authorities
that the exports were as follow: in 1791&mdash;</p>

<table id="t01" summary="t01">

<p class="p1">And that there were employed for all the purposes
of cultivation, four hundred and fifty-five thousand
slaves. The most productive year under his sway,
will be found to exhibit the following returns of exports:&mdash;</p>

<table id="t02" summary="t02">

<p class="p1">According to Mr. Humboldt, the cultivators employed
to carry on the whole of the works of agriculture,
and to produce the above exports, did not
exceed two hundred and ninety thousand. In addition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
to the foregoing returns should be taken into
consideration the condition into which the soil had
been brought by the exertions and the judicious
measures pursued by this chief from the year 1798,
when he became the leader of the people, to the time
of his seizure. All those estates on which culture
had so successfully recommenced, were so much
improved by his system, that the greatest expectations
were entertained respecting the produce of
future exertions; but the fall of this chief, and the
renewal of the contest between the people and the
French, threw every thing again into confusion, and
the work of cultivation for a time ceased, with the
exception of the exertions made by the women, who
applied themselves to labour, and their efforts were
not altogether unavailing, for they proceeded with
the lighter labour of the plantations, which was exceedingly
beneficial.</p>

<p>When Dessalines assumed the command, the
country was in a state of great irritability, and he
could not therefore devote that attention to agriculture
which his predecessor had done. But when he
had succeeded in expelling the French from the
island, and had restored some degree of tranquillity,
and the people became somewhat free from apprehension
of future broils, he began to devise means
for reviving cultivation; but he wanted the discretion
and the temper, as well as that knowledge of
the people which Toussaint possessed. The latter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
pursued a system of culture, that in the first instance
was easy and acceptable to them, and when
he saw that they began to relax in their duty,
he began to enforce it more rigidly, and under the
sanction of the law inflicted punishment with no
light hand, in cases of disobedience and refractory
conduct. But Dessalines acted differently and most
injudiciously, for he rushed upon the cultivators so
suddenly, and with so tyrannical a hand, that disobedience
began to be general; and those people who
had in his predecessor’s time been the most industrious
and most forward in setting an example to
their fellow-labourers became supine and inactive
through his oppressive proceedings. Dessalines
knew well that force alone could compel his countrymen
to work, and that nothing could be obtained
from them if they were left to their own will; but
he was too precipitate and hasty in introducing his
measures of coercion. He even compelled his soldiers
to labour in the field in parties, on such of the
government estates as had not been farmed out, and
for which they received a trifling addition to their
regular military pay. But all his exertions were ineffectual
in producing such returns as those which
followed the efforts of Toussaint. Both knew that
coercion was the only way by which cultivation could
be carried on, and they both resorted to it. With
one it succeeded in a degree which equalled his most
sanguine expectations, because he advanced progressively,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
and the people did not feel it so severely;
whilst the other burst upon the cultivators
with an unmerciful hand and inflicted such punishments
for disobedience as made them determine on
resistance, and the consequence was, that a revolt followed,
and Dessalines fell. By a document given
me by an individual now living in Hayti, and who
was attached to the suite of the tyrant, it appears
that with all his power and exertions, his returns
from the soil fell much below those of his predecessor.
In 1804, which seems to have yielded about
the largest return of his three years, the exports
were the following:&mdash;</p>

<table id="t03" summary="t03">

 <tr>
  <td>Sugar</td>
  <td class="tdr">47,600,000</td>
  <td class="tdc">pounds.</td>

  <td class="tdc">hogsheads.</td>
 </tr>

</table>

<p class="p1">The number of the cultivators at this period has
not been stated, though I have been informed by
respectable individuals that they were as numerous
as in the time of Toussaint, but that from the very
harsh proceedings of Dessalines a great number left
their homes and fled to the eastern part of the island,
and there lived in the woods and recesses of the
mountains until they heard of his death.</p>

<p>In the time of Christophe and Petion the culture
of the soil was carried on by the former with some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
spirit, whilst the latter allowed it to relax in a most
extraordinary degree. Christophe pursued it with
strong compulsory measures, as may be seen by his
adoption of the code of Toussaint, but Petion left
every thing to the will and inclination of his people.
The government of the north, by means of its agricultural
pre-eminence, had a flowing treasury, and
its people advanced in affluence from the effects of
industry; but the government of the south, from
supineness and from a disregard of cultivation, was
reduced to the lowest state of poverty, and was
driven to expedients exceedingly ruinous in their
consequences. By Christophe the people were
taught to love agricultural pursuits, as conducive
to their happiness and comforts; and were made to
understand that cultivation would be enforced, and
that the disobedient and the indolent would be
visited with the full penalty of the law. By Petion
every class of persons were permitted to pursue
those courses to which their tastes and their will led
them. Uncontrolled by any regulations of the state,
they never pursued cultivation beyond their own
immediate wants; and beyond the supply of those
wants, which were inconsiderable, no surplus was
left for the use of government or for the purposes
of commerce. Whilst the north excited some degree
of interest in the mind of the traveller as he pursued
his journey through its several districts, by an appearance
of industry and cultivation, the south displayed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
little more than occasional spots of vegetation,
and the eye wandered over an expanse of country
in a state of waste and neglect. The mistaken
policy of Petion ruined the progress of agriculture in
his part, and all his after efforts to restore its wonted
vigour were ineffectual and unavailing. Fondly confiding
that his people would without compulsion devote
the whole of their time to the pursuits of industry,
he permitted them to indulge in those propensities
to which they were naturally prone. But
instead of keeping pace with their northern neighbours
in the progress of agricultural industry, they
evidently receded beyond the possibility of recovery,
and not a chance was left that agriculture
would revive under the weak and ineffectual measures
of Petion’s government.</p>

<p>Christophe most advantageously farmed out the
government estates, and at the same time he gave
to the farmers of them every possible support; but
he most strictly bound them to push the culture of
their lands as far as it was practicable from the
paucity of labourers; and he also ordained the portion
of labour which might be exacted from each
of them. Every individual in the least acquainted
with the portion of labour allotted for the slave in
the British colonies will readily admit, that the labour
performed by them, far from being excessive,
does not exceed the ordinary labour of man in general
throughout the agricultural countries in Europe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
or the United States of America. From
every account which I have been able to collect,
and from the testimony of living persons, Christophe
exacted from every labourer the full performance
of a day’s labour as provided for by the twenty-second
article of the law for regulating the culture
of soil, and which forms a part of the Code Henry,
and every proprietor who did not enforce it incurred
his severest censure. The only thing which impeded
the great advancement of cultivation in his
dominions was his contest with Petion, and the necessity
which that occasioned for his keeping up a
powerful military establishment, which took away the
most able of the cultivators for the army.</p>

<p>After the union of the three divisions of the island
under the republic, some hopes were entertained
that Boyer would concert measures for reviving agriculture,
although from his election to the presidential
chair after the death of Petion, he had given no
proofs, nor evinced the least desire to disturb the
cultivators, but allowed them to follow such courses
as seemed most congenial to their habits, and consequently,
instead of any improvement in the condition
of the country, there was evidently a greater decline;
and as the population had been greatly increased,
the whole country tranquil, and without the
appearance of any interruption being given to it, a
period more favourable could not have arrived for
effecting a change of a system, which he must have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
seen was attended with the most baneful consequences.</p>

<p>I shall now advert to the quantity of produce obtained
from the soil after the union, and it seems,
from the returns which were laid before the public
in 1823, and subsequently from a note which I had
presented to me in Hayti, that the year 1822, the
first year after the union, was the most productive,
and that since that period there has been an evident
decline. In 1822, the exports stood thus:&mdash;</p>

<table id="t04" summary="t04">

  <td>Coffee</td>
  <td class="tdr">35,117,834</td>

<p class="p1">The whole value of which, in Hayti, seems to have
been estimated at about nine millions, thirty thousand,
three hundred and ninety-seven dollars, and
the export duties one million, three hundred and
sixty-five thousand, four hundred and two dollars;
together, ten millions, three hundred and ninety-five
thousand, seven hundred and ninety-nine dollars, or
about two millions, seventy-nine thousand, one hundred
and fifty-nine pounds sterling, taking the value
of the dollar as in Hayti at four shillings sterling.
No subsequent year has been equal in produce to
1822, and in 1825 the returns are infinitely less, for
the quantity of coffee does not exceed thirty million<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
pounds, sugar seven hundred and fifty thousand
pounds, and the other articles somewhat less in proportion.
The valuation of the whole in 1825 is
stated at eight millions of dollars, or thereabouts.
Such is the wretched state to which the improvident
measures of Boyer has brought agriculture in Hayti,
and in this condition would the republic have remained,
had he not attended to the suggestions of
men wiser than himself, who have some knowledge
of governing, and who are not such bigots as to be
led by a mistaken philanthropy, when they perceive
their country sinking under its injurious effects.</p>

<p>An individual now high in the councils of Boyer
made the strongest remonstrances against the unwise
policy which he followed; and the late Baron
Dupuy, a man who knew how the best interests
of his country might be upheld, declared to him
that by pursuing such a line in future he would
bring the republic to the brink of ruin. That it was
folly to think of any expedients for raising their national
wealth and consequence, except by encouraging
and enforcing the cultivation of the soil, and
extending their commercial intercourse by every
possible means, for that agriculture and commerce
were the only sources of national wealth.</p>

<p>When we look into the state of the products in
the time of Toussaint, and compare them with those
of Boyer, it is a just conclusion to draw, that the one
knew his people, and the other feared them; that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
the former by compulsory means enriched his country,
and kept the people quiet, whilst the latter, by
giving unlimited latitude to indolence, has impoverished
and ruined them. This is the more extraordinary,
also, when we look at the means of each
chief for cultivating the soil, and the strength of
the population at the respective periods. Toussaint’s
population, according to Humboldt, only amounted
to three hundred and seventy-five thousand, and by
the census taken in 1824, when the island was incorporated
under Boyer’s government, it amounted
to nine hundred and thirty-five thousand, three hundred
and thirty-five, so that in 1822 it could not
have been many short of that number. And supposing
therefore the census of Boyer to be correct,
was such an astonishing decrease ever known in the
means of any country in the world, and arising too
from the incapacity of its ruler and the weakness
of its government?</p>

<p>When poverty began to be felt, and the exigences
of the state became alarmingly pressing,
Boyer became convinced that his policy had been
defective and ruinous, and that it was time to concert
plans for rousing himself from the lethargy
into which he had fallen. He was forced to seek
advice from the very people whose counsels he had
before rejected with disdain. He courted them, and
even begged, that they would suggest the most
beneficial plans for relieving the country from that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
dilemma into which his precipitancy and obstinacy
had thrown it. They again stepped forward, and
their first suggestion was a <i>rigid system of agriculture</i>,
the revival of Toussaint’s principle of culture,
and the strict enforcement of it without any evasion
or escape. It was by coercion that Toussaint, Dessalines,
and even Christophe, raised their country,
and by coercion only could Hayti recover its pristine
condition. Her prosperity had received a stab,
and it required skill and experience to restore her
wonted vigour.</p>

<p>It is evident that the sugar plantations were nearly
all thrown up, as the country scarcely produced more
than was necessary for its own consumption. There
were a few only that had the appearance of being
cultivated, and those were in the possession of individuals
connected with the government either in
a civil or military capacity. On these plantations
the work was generally performed by labouring parties
from the military stations in their vicinity; and
if labourers from the general class of cultivators were
engaged, they never omitted to exact from them a
due proportion of work, and they were always superintended
by the gens d’armes, or country police,
armed for the sole purpose of compelling them to
the performance of their duty.</p>

<p>A variety of expedients were tried, it is true, by
the leading proprietors in the country, but more particularly
by the military ones, for the purpose of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
advancing cultivation by the most effectual means.
The cane, requiring a greater proportion of labour
than any other of the staple articles of growth, was
little attended to; it seemed therefore adviseable to
hold out inducements to prevail upon the people
to undertake its culture. In many instances, I have
been informed, the proprietors have not only offered
them a fourth of the produce, but they have actually
promised a pecuniary remuneration in addition
to it. Even this would not induce them to
work, and nothing therefore remained but to adopt
a system of compulsory labour. That compulsion
was resorted to, is a fact; but the law was not sufficiently
strong to punish offenders in the case of
disobedience, and many delinquents, many of the
refractory labourers, who had engaged to perform a
certain portion of duty on a plantation, but neglected
to do so, escaped that punishment which
they deserved.</p>

<p>The law for the better observance of the culture
of the soil, until the Code Rural, of which I shall
speak hereafter, made its appearance, was extremely
deficient, and merely compelled all cultivators to
remain on their respective settlements, and to attend
to the duties required on them, except on Saturday
and Sunday, and such holidays as were particularly
enumerated; but there was no penalty for disobedience
sufficient to deter a man from being guilty of
it. As far however as the proprietors dared to go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
in enforcing labour, many of them certainly proceeded,
and in several instances I have seen the
labourers working under the terror of the bayonet
and sabre, and this too on the plantations of Boyer
himself. I have seen it also on those of Secretary-General
Inginac, Colonel Lerebour, General Jeddion,
and General Mazuy, and several others.</p>

<p>It was evident to every man in Hayti, at all conversant
with the negro character, that an attempt to
keep up cultivation without force was impossible,
and many of the proprietors, themselves negroes,
knew that by force only could they obtain labourers
amongst their people. They knew that indolence in
the negro was innate, and that it was absolutely impracticable
to carry on the work in the soil unless
rigid laws were enacted to enforce it. The laws
which had been passed by Toussaint and Dessalines
had become so mutilated by relaxation and modification,
that they were little more than a dead letter;
and the government, recovering from its apathy, and
feeling the consequences of its loss of energy and
want of decision, very wisely remonstrated with the
president, and condemned further submission to the
will of a people desirous to go on unrestrained in
their indolent propensities. This remonstrance was
effectual, and Boyer acquiesced in the necessity of
establishing a system of extensive cultivation, and
of enacting a law to provide for its due observance
throughout his dominions. He saw the good effects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
which had arisen from the application of force on
his own plantation at Tor, on which the cultivators
worked under the surveillance of a military guard;
and he therefore became now as willing an advocate
for a law to sanction coercive labour, as he had been
negligent in not providing for the culture of the soil
from the beginning of his power.</p>

<p>The Code Rural, the existence of which has been
the subject of much doubt, was passed by the Chamber
of Communes on the 21st of April, 1826, admitted
by the senate on the 1st of May, and received the
president’s fiat on the 6th of the same month. All this
took place during my residence in Port au Prince.
This law is the work of Secretary-General Inginac,
aided by one or two of the members from the chamber
and the senate. During the discussion of this
law in the Chamber of Communes, it was remarked
by one of the most intelligent of its members, “that
it was a measure of expediency, for that the citizen
cultivators had become so indolent that agriculture
had in some districts been almost forgotten, and
that cultivation was completely suspended.” This
declaration was echoed through the chamber, and
every member concurred in the observation, and gave
it his unqualified assent.</p>

<p>On the 1st of May, the day appointed for the celebration
of the Fête Agriculture, and when the cultivators
were assembled in the public square bearing
specimens of their several productions of the soil,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
the president, together with a member from the
chamber and another from the senate, addressed
them, and said that the legislature would provide
for a more general cultivation, and that all persons
not engaged, or usually occupied as labourers,
would be peremptorily called upon for a more strict
attention to their duty, as the government contemplated
a revival of agriculture, which had fallen into
so much neglect from the indolent habits of the
people. These addresses <i>were not</i> received with
acclamation, and many a cultivator heard them with
a degree of dissatisfaction which seemed to forebode
resistance.</p>

<p>The Chamber of Communes, in its farewell address,
tells the people that laws “just and severe”
were imperative for the revival of agriculture, and
that by the law which they had passed to enforce
cultivation they thought that they had materially
served their country, and in such an opinion I most
readily concur. They rendered to their country an
important service by passing the Code Rural; for
it will tend towards obstructing the course of immorality
pursued by the people in their idleness, and
will eventually reestablish upon a sound basis the
shattered finances of the state. The passage in that
address is so very forcible, and so extremely just,
that I shall call the attention of my readers to it, as
it has been given by a gentleman to whom I am
under many obligations for his assistance upon various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
rious subjects connected with this work. It says,
“What is due to the conservative principle would
not have been provided, if the revival of our agriculture
had not been stimulated (provoqué) by
laws at once just and severe; your representatives
in passing the Code Rural, have believed that a
benefit was conferred upon the people.” This was
conclusive of the opinion of the country that severity
was imperative for enforcing a general cultivation,
and that, without laws “just and severe”, force
cannot be resorted to with any chance of a favourable
result.</p>

<p>It may not be unimportant to give a few of the
articles of the Code Rural. This Code has now
found its way to Europe, and the public, on reading
its enactments, will be enabled to judge of the
feelings of the leading persons in Hayti with regard
to the state of cultivation, when such laws are said
to be required to force the people to labour.</p>

<p>“Art. 173. The purposes of Rural Police are,</p>

<p>“First. The repressing idleness.</p>

<p>“Second. Enforcing order and assiduity in agricultural
labour.</p>

<p>“Third. The discipline of the labourers collectively
or in gangs.</p>

<p>“Fourth. The making and keeping in repair of
the roads, both public and private.</p>

<p>“Art. 174. All persons who are not proprietors
or renters of the land on which they are residing, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
who shall not have made a contract to work with
some proprietor or renter, shall be reputed vagabonds,
and shall be arrested by the rural police of
the section in which they may be found, and carried
before the justice of the peace of the commune.</p>

<p>“Art. 175. The justice of the peace, after interrogating
and hearing the person brought before him,
shall make known to him the articles of the law which
oblige him to employ himself in agricultural labour;
and after that communication he shall remand him
to prison, until he shall have bound himself by a
contract according to the provisions of the law.</p>

<p>“Art. 176. The justice of the peace will allow the
person arrested to make his own choice of the individual
with whom he is to contract to labour.</p>

<p>“Art. 177. If, after eight days of detention, the
prisoner shall not have agreed to go to field work,
he shall be sent to the public works for cleaning the
town or district where he may be arrested, and there
he shall be employed until he shall consent to go to
field labour. The person who removes any labourer
from the public works to employ him in private
work shall be subject to a fine of fifty dollars, of
which a moiety is to be paid to the person complaining.</p>

<p>“Art. 178. If the prisoner be a child under age,
the justice of the peace shall inquire out his parents,
and send him to them to follow their condition of
life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span></p>

<p>“Art. 179. After the expiration of three months
from the publication of this Code, rigorous measures
shall be enforced against delinquents.</p>

<p>“Art. 180. Every person attached to the country
as a cultivator, who shall on a working day, and
during the hours of labour, be found unemployed,
or lounging on the public roads, shall be considered
idle, and be arrested and taken before the justice of
the peace, who shall commit him to prison for
twenty-four hours for the first offence, and shall
send him to labour on the public works upon a repetition
of the offence.</p>

<p>“Art. 181. To provide against vagabondage,
under the pretence of being a soldier.</p>

<p>“Art. 182. Officers commanding the rural police
shall take care that in their respective sections no
person shall live in idleness. For this purpose they
have authority to oblige such persons as are not actually
employed in labour, to give an account of
their occupations; and such persons as cannot prove
that they cultivate the soil, or are keepers of cattle-pens,
shall be considered as without visible means
of procuring their livelihood, and shall be arrested
as vagabonds.</p>

<p>“Art. 183. Field labour shall commence on
Monday morning, and shall never cease until Friday
evening (legal holidays excepted); and in extraordinary
cases, when the interest of the cultivator<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
as well as of the proprietor appears to require
it, work shall be continued until Saturday evening.</p>

<p>“Art. 184. On working days, the ordinary field
labour shall commence at day-dawn, to continue
until mid-day, with the interval of half an hour for
breakfast, which shall be taken on the spot where
the work is carrying on. After mid-day the field
labour shall commence at two o’clock, and continue
until sun-set.</p>

<p>“Art. 185. Pregnant females shall be employed
on light work only, and after the fourth month of
pregnancy they shall not be obliged to do any work
in the field.</p>

<p>“Art. 186. Four months after delivery they shall
be obliged to resume the labour in the field; but
they shall not turn out to work until one hour after
sun-rise; they shall continue to work until eleven
o’clock, and from two o’clock until one hour before
sun-set.</p>

<p>“Art. 187. No labourer attached to an estate in
the country shall absent himself from the labour
assigned him, without the permission of the overseer,
in the absence of the proprietor or farmer;
and no one shall give that permission unless the case
be urgent.</p>

<p>“Art. 188. Gangs of labourers upon estates shall
be obedient to their drivers, jobbers, sub-farmers,
farmers, proprietors and managers, or overseers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
whenever they are called upon to execute the labour
they have bound themselves to perform.</p>

<p>“Art. 189. Every act of disobedience or insult
on the part of a workman commanded to do any work,
to which he is subjected, shall be punished by imprisonment,
according to the exigency of the case,
in the discretion of the justice of the peace of the
commune.</p>

<p>“Art. 190. Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays
being at the entire disposal of the labourers, they
shall not be permitted on working days to leave their
work, to indulge in dancing or feasting, neither by
night nor by day. Delinquents shall be subject to
imprisonment for three days for the first offence, for
six days for the repetition of the offence.”</p>

<p>The remaining articles of the code relate to the
making of roads and keeping them in repair.</p>

<p>“These clauses are given as more particularly
exhibiting the effect of the code on the field labourer.
To exhibit the whole system by which the driver is
made answerable for the labourer, the overseer for
his drivers and labourers, and the police, in its various
grades, for the whole, it would be necessary to
translate the entire code. During imprisonment,
the labourer being absent from field work forfeits
his wages; the pregnant women also appear to receive
no wages during their exemption.”<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span></p>

<p>It is impossible for any one who is at all conversant
with the negro character not to say, that the
Code Rural is just such a law as the exigences of
Hayti particularly require: and that it is absolutely
and imperatively called for in order to extend cultivation,
and to bring the people to some sense of duty
towards their country and themselves. Left any
longer to pursue their uncontrolled and unlimited
propensity for indolence, they must recede into barbarism
and uncivilization, and the country fall a
sacrifice to the mistaken policy of its chief and the
leaders of his government, and to those false ideas
of philanthropy with which they are so often assailed
by persons who are incompetent to advise,
because they are without any knowledge of the
country or its people.</p>

<p>The Code Rural, therefore, now enforces labour
with a rigid hand,&mdash;nothing more excessive can be
demanded of the slave in the British colonies; and
I aver, that if the whole of the clauses of this code
be complied with, it will exceed the labour performed
by persons in actual slavery. I have my doubts,
however, respecting the feasibility of carrying its
clauses into successful operation, and whether the
temper of the people at the present moment will be
submissive enough to adhere to it in all its parts,
I am inclined to think that they have been too long
indulged in those vices which seem inherent in the
negro, to be brought to obedience; and that too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
rigid an enforcement will bring on discontent, and
finally a general resistance. I think it therefore exceedingly
probable that Boyer with all his vaunting,
with all his proclamations, and aided by his military
force, will never proceed to those extremities
to promote agriculture, to which he can now go under
the sanction of laws made expressly for that
purpose. The Code Rural must unquestionably
astonish those advocates for free labour who have
held up Hayti as an example of what can be accomplished
by it; and I think they cannot now have the
temerity to say that cultivation in the tropics can be
effectually carried on without coercion, when even
the Haytian government is constrained to have
recourse to it. For my part, I have seen nothing in
Hayti to induce me to alter the opinion which I
have always entertained of the negro, nor for a
moment to expect that cultivation can be carried
on with any probability of success without coercion.
But I declare it to be my firm conviction,
that unless coercion be resorted to, the negro will
not labour. The impulse for indulging in sloth and
in indolence is too irresistible, and it will not be in
the power of the government to make any progress
in agricultural labour, except it be done by actual
force.</p>

<p>The system pursued by the Haytian government
respecting the disposal of its lands seems to be erroneous.
Allotting it out in small grants of ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
to fifteen acres, is an injudicious measure: it only
tends towards extending and perpetuating the evil
and pernicious habits of the people. When a negro
obtains a grant of a small tract of land, he cares
little about the cultivation of it beyond the production
of enough for his own immediate wants, and
those wants are trifling. Two or three hours’ labour
in each week will suffice to answer all the
purposes of the culture required to produce food
enough for himself; the rest of his time is then allowed
to dwindle away in the most puerile pleasures
and inconsistencies. No object which moderate
industry could procure would balance the insatiable
desire for reposing under the shade of the
guava, and for ablutions in the neighbouring
stream; with these and a little food all his wants
are supplied. Such being the case, and known to
be so by the government, it is enough to surprise
one that they should parcel out their lands in this
way, because, even under the Code Rural, the
person holding it is no longer a labourer, but a proprietor,
and is not therefore amenable to it. Had
the government proceeded differently, and let the
estates to farm as they were originally laid out, so
many petty proprietors would not have existed, but
would have remained amenable to the law for enforcing
cultivation. From this unwise system, labourers
are scarce in Hayti, and the few that are to
be obtained are of the worst characters, negroes so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
abandoned as not to have been considered worthy
of inheriting a patch of land. Hayti abounds with
these small proprietors; their patches of land, with
their huts upon them, are generally situate in the
mountains, in the recesses, or on the most elevated
parts, on spots, as the poet has described, “the most
inaccessible by shepherds trod.” They are therefore
lost for the purposes of agriculture: their cultivation
does not extend beyond vegetables for the markets
in their vicinity, added to which they furnish an occasional
supply of pork, poultry, and wild pigeons.</p>

<p>Another important question arises on this subject,
and that is the quantum of labour which a
negro is capable of performing within the day. In
the British colonies an experienced planter can at
once discern how much labour a slave is capable of
performing. He can also discriminate between slaves
who are willing and industrious, and those who are
careless and indolent; and apportions their labour
according to their respective deserts and capacities.
The Haytian proprietor is deficient in these requisites;
he is not a planter practically, and he
is ignorant of its theory. There is nothing regular
in his system; it is an anomaly, a strange, incongruous
method of proceeding, having no tendency
either to improve the soil or benefit himself.
The sugar planter in the first place is so ignorant
that he knows not the virtue which his soil possesses,
nor what it is capable of producing. He considers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
not whether one field is better adapted for the
production of canes than another, but plants indiscriminately
in bad or good soil, in heavy or light;
in fact he knows not whether it ought to be planted
with canes or cotton, or if it would be wise to allow
it to become common pastures. He is contented, and
seems to be quite satisfied, if he can but obtain vegetation
in any way; careless about the manner in
which it is accomplished. To ascertain whether it
can be improved by art or industry, is a matter
about which he is unconcerned.</p>

<p>But the cane is not often planted. Most of the
cane pieces on plantations are old, probably they
were planted by the French, or subsequently in the
time of Toussaint. They exhibit an appearance of
age, for their circumference is small, and their joints
are not more than three inches apart, nor do they
ever exceed four feet in length. These are very
seldom manured or trashed, nor do they receive any
attention from the time of cutting until they are
again ready for the mill the following year. There
is no such thing as stirring the soil between the rows
at particular times, nor do the cultivators ever trouble
themselves about divesting the cane of its superfluous
and decaying leaves, so as to open a free course
for the air through the whole. Nothing of this is done
in Hayti. The fertility of the soil, the congeniality
of climate, and the regularity of seasons, suffice for
manure, and the rest is left to nature. Art and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
industry of man contribute little or nothing to the
growth of the cane. The hoe and other implements
of tillage are rendered useless by indolence, the
planter’s unconquerable love of ease having brought
them into disrepute; and I shall be somewhat
astonished if the Code Rural will have power enough
to revive their use.</p>

<p>The same irregularity attends the operations
at the mill, the boiling-house, the distillery, and
the other departments of the plantation. I have
been through them often, and have been surprised
at the want of order which every where prevails.
There is nothing systematically arranged,&mdash;every
thing seems in confusion; the works are
detached, and resemble more a heap of ruins
than conveniences for manufacturing and distilling.
The interior of the boiling-house would astonish a
Jamaica planter: the several boilers are not ranged
in succession from the receiver to the teacher, as
they are in the British colonies. They are placed
without rule, and in their manner of conveying the
liquor from one copper to another the waste is considerable;
and this is observable too in all their
operations. There is nothing like cleanliness in
their works; filth and every species of dirtiness are
to be seen in them; and this is prevalent, although
they must be sensible that it is injurious, and often
destructive to the quality of the sugar. The distillery
department is also very injudiciously constructed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
They take no pains to keep the heat at
the proper degree requisite for fermentation: every
thing has the appearance of negligence, and conveys
to the observer a very bad specimen of Haytian
skill in the art of manufacturing sugar or of
distilling spirits. They do not often make rum:
I only know of one or two plantations on which
rum is distilled, and these are conducted by Englishmen;
one in particular at Aux Cayes, a Mr.
Towning, who has an extensive distillery. He produces
rum, which, in point of flavour, strength, and
every other quality, I do not think inferior to that
of Jamaica. To all persons who visit Aux Cayes
this gentleman is well known for the hearty and hospitable
reception he always gives to a stranger. He
is the only person in Hayti who devotes his attention
to the distillation of rum. The Haytians cannot
distill it; they are ignorant of its principle, and consequently
confine themselves to the distillation of
what is known in the British colonies under the denomination
of low wines. The flavour of this spirit
is most unpleasant; which arises, I conjecture, from
the ingredients thrown into the fermenting vessels,
and from which it is distilled: these, consisting of the
molasses from the boiling-house, with all the sweepings
of the works, with a proportion of water from
any pool however stagnant, if pure water be not
near, I apprehend give to the spirit a very acrid
quality, as well as a fetid smell. It is however<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
held in great estimation by the people, who drink
it freely, and they can obtain it cheap. Upon the
whole there can be no difficulty in declaring that
the Haytians are ignorant both of the cultivation of
the cane, and of the process of manufacturing
sugar.</p>

<p>It is evident that sugar is not much cultivated,
as in every district throughout the republic there are
only a few plantations to be seen in the plains of Cul
de Sac and vicinity of Port au Prince where sugar
is produced. There were in the time of the French
about one hundred and forty sugar estates, very few,
if any, with less than one thousand acres of land, one-fourth
of which would be in canes, and the remainder
in pastures and other crops. Now in the same space
there are not more than twenty estates, and in each
of them there cannot be found more than from forty
to fifty acres of canes, the remainder of the land
being in a neglected state, overrun with different
weeds. President Boyer has an estate within a
small distance of Port au Prince, called Tor, the
favourite residence of the late Petion. This plantation
has upwards of two thousand acres of land
attached to it, and, from the great strength of the
soil, it is impossible to select a spot more eligible
for the production of sugar. But there are not
more than forty acres of the land in canes. This,
however, is not singular; it is general throughout
the island. When the sugar cane in Hayti was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
cultivated properly, and received the requisite care
and attention in the several stages of its growth,
it produced very abundantly. Bryan Edwards gives
an average of two thousand seven hundred and
twelve pounds of sugar per acre through the island;
and at this period I have been informed, and in fact
I have seen it calculated myself, that in the plains
of Cul de Sac and Leogane the average does not exceed
one thousand pounds of sugar per acre; and
an experienced planter on looking at the canes
when they are ripe for cutting, would conclude
that they would not produce so much. Formerly
a pound of sugar was obtained from a gallon of
juice in some districts, in others sixteen pounds
from twenty gallons, and in some sixteen pounds
from twenty-four gallons: but now it requires
nearly treble the quantity of juice to produce the
same quantity of sugar: and this must remain so,
until a new system of cultivation be tried, and the
management of the plantations be entrusted to
men of experience, men who have been practical
planters, and who are conversant with the whole of
its duties; men, I say, who have a perfect knowledge
of the soil, its capabilities and its wants for the
work of tillage, and who will devote their time and
attention to all the minutiæ of plantation labour.
If such a system should ever be pursued in Hayti,
and there be labourers to cultivate, and capital can
be invested securely, then sugar planting may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
carried on with some chance of a successful issue:
until this take place, I have great doubts whether
the culture of the cane will prove profitable to the
occupier of the soil.</p>

<p>The labour required for the cultivation of coffee
is exceedingly light: I was therefore much surprised
to see the very little progress the people
had made in this branch of agriculture. When
an individual, who has been accustomed to plantations
in the British, French, and Spanish islands,
visits the coffee plantations in Hayti, and
observes the whole conducted without judgment or
care, it impresses him with a most unfavourable
idea of the people; and when he sees the easiest
branch of agriculture so much neglected, it convinces
him that their idleness is almost invincible.
In the British islands every coffee plantation is
arranged with the greatest exactitude. The lands are
divided into fields as nearly equal as possible, and
in those fields, in all probability, the coffee has been
planted in successive seasons, so that when the
period arrives in which the trees begin to exhibit a
decline in their growth, the planter provides for the
loss of them by planting others, and by this expedient
manages always to keep up his crop. The
fences which divide the fields are constantly kept up
with regularity and order, the whole having the
appearance of a garden laid out with neatness and
precision. The plantation works for washing, drying,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
and preparing the coffee, are in the best condition,
and with the barbacues, exhibit a well-arranged
system for the production of the berry. In Hayti
the scene is different: what is denominated there
a coffee plantation, is neither more nor less than a
large tract of land, throughout which grows spontaneously
the coffee tree; not planted there by the
people, but sprung from the seed which has fallen
from those planted by the French, and which escaped
destruction during the revolution. There is no such
thing as a plantation established upon the same
principle as in other islands. There are no divisions,
no laying out of the lands, no order of planting in
succession, nothing done towards improving and
fertilizing the soil, in order to aid the growth of the
tree, no lopping it of its excrescences, and pruning
it to strengthen the parent stem; but every thing is
left to nature, the pruning knife is sheathed, and
the rank luxuriance of the tree is permitted to increase,
whilst the hoe is seldom called into use, to
extirpate those weeds which are so destructive to
vegetation.</p>

<p>A person must be somewhat conversant with travelling
in Hayti before he can discover on his road
that a coffee plantation is near him. For my
part, I could see nothing that resembled one, nor
should I have known the coffee tree, growing as it
did in a pyramidal form, surrounded by numberless
other shrubs, had it not been for the appearance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
a few red berries on one of its lower branches. I
alighted from my mule to examine some trees just
round the spot: as nearly as I could ascertain, every
tree must have exceeded twelve feet in height, and
I am convinced that each of them at the time would
not have produced two pounds of coffee in the husk.
I had the curiosity to go a little way into the interior
of this settlement to see if there were any thing
like cultivation, but I could discover nothing bearing
the least resemblance to a plantation. I saw
nothing but a hut, and four or five people in it,
whom I found to be the proprietors of the place.
They were inquisitive, and not much pleased that I
should have intruded on their privacy, and therefore
I had a hint from my guide that it would be
prudent not to advance farther. I saw, however,
enough to convince me that there was no regular
system of cultivation pursued in this place, although
there were twelve hundred acres of land in the
Keen; and that the coffee grew in a wild state, the
soil never being touched or disturbed, save, occasionally,
by pigs, goats and asses, which range
through the whole, and feed on the grass which
grows luxuriantly in the intervals. Mills are not very
common, and the few which exist are very small
and turned by asses. Washing and pulping are not
performed by machinery. Indeed I am inclined to
suspect that they are dispensed with altogether, as
I could not find any apparatus for these operations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
My guide knew this plantation well, and he told me,
that although the proprietor had this large tract of
land, yet he was so poor that he could not afford to
hire cultivators, who, when employed, never did work
enough to pay for their hire. I was anxious to ascertain
the annual quantity of coffee which this
place produced, and I was told that it did not exceed
four thousand five hundred pounds weight. I have
mentioned this plantation because it is considered
to be a settlement in a productive part of the country,
the mountains of Leogane; and extraordinary
as it may appear, it is a very good illustration of
the coffee settlements in general, all of which exhibit
negligence and want of that industry which
characterize the Haytian planter and cultivator.</p>

<p>Cotton, which formerly was an article much grown
in Hayti, is now greatly neglected, although the
labour attending it is very inconsiderable, the people
having no wish to extend cultivation to those
products of the soil which require planting annually.
It is both an annual and a perennial plant,
but the former is esteemed as most productive, whilst
the latter is somewhat out of repute from not affording
such profitable returns. In some of the districts,
when in possession of the French, from the
extreme luxuriance of the soil, a planter could obtain,
from the labour of one man, six thousand pounds
of it annually; but in these more modern times,
and under the free labour system, not more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
six hundred pounds can be obtained, and even that
is only partial, and not a general thing. In the
vicinity of Gonaives it is more cultivated than in
any other district, the soil in the uplands being
more congenial for its growth than it is in any other
part of the island. In the time of the French it
produced about three millions and a half of pounds
weight, but in 1825 the crop only amounted to five
hundred and twenty thousand pounds. With lands
so exceedingly fertile, so peculiarly adapted for the
cultivation of this plant, it is not a very cheering
prospect to see that free labour is able to accomplish
so little in the production of an article of culture that
requires such trifling exertion. What might not be
accomplished by an industrious race of people in
the production of cotton, in a country so favourable
to its growth? If it were possible to waft the industry
of the peasantry of Great Britain to the shores of
Hayti, what an extraordinary effect would it have
in the production of an article, the superior quality
of which would so amply repay the tillers for their
industry and care. But the Haytians care not for
these things; they are totally unconcerned about the
growth of any article for foreign consumption; they
seem to have no desire beyond that of cultivating the
few vegetables required for their own immediate use,
leaving all other things to the effects of nature, even
valuable articles of spontaneous growth being sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
permitted to rise and fall into decay without
becoming the object of the cultivator’s attention.</p>

<p>The culture of cocoa is not now attended to, except,
I believe, in the vicinity of Jeremie. It is a
plant the nature of which is peculiarly delicate, and
requires shade as well as moisture, and it is material
to its growth, that it should be defended
against the powerful rays of the sun. The labour
of cultivating it is very trifling; the most important
duty which it requires is to guard it during its approach
to perfection against the macaw and the
parrot, for wherever they touch the pod, destruction
ensues. It may be considered a perennial plant, for
the fruit is found upon it throughout the greater
part of the year, though there are two principal
crops, which are gathered in June and December.
After it is gathered great care must be taken of it,
for before it is prepared for market it receives a
sweat by the application of salt water, which destroys
any vermin that may have got into it, and,
it is said, preserves its hue. Any vegetable production
requiring so much care in the culture and
preparation of it will never become extensively cultivated
in Hayti, although it may be exceedingly
profitable. The Haytians cannot confine themselves
to any settled system of planting; and cocoa
therefore requiring the greatest possible aid
through the whole progress of its growth, as well as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
much attention after it is picked, will never be an
article of very general culture, however valuable it
may be to the planter.</p>

<p>Although there are a great many fields in which
the indigo grows wild, and settlements in which it was
once extensively cultivated still exist, yet at this period
but very little is produced. Its cultivation requires
the greatest care, for it has to go through a very
long process, from the picking of the leaves on which
the blue is found until it is fit to be removed into
chests. This is too much for the fickle Haytian
planter to undergo. It is said to be a plant that cannot
be cultivated without shade and moisture, and
that it will not bear any other vegetable near it without
sustaining great injury. It is a plant also that
exhausts the soil very considerably indeed, and at the
end of two years it has not only become degenerated,
but the land which bore it becomes weak and unfit to
be again used for its production. After the loss of
Hayti to the French, they made experiments on its
growth in some parts of their dominions in Europe,
and they are I think stated to have been successful,
but the quantity which they raised was small. The
indigo from Guatemala is esteemed the finest, and
in that republic is an article of very extensive
cultivation, and a source of great wealth to the
people who cultivate it; but the native Spaniards
and the Indians of that country are a very industrious
race of people, and leave nothing untried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
which may improve their country, or enrich themselves.</p>

<p>I am astonished that the cochineal insect was
never extensively sought after, and the raising of it
more generally attended to in Hayti, as the cactus,
or prickly pear, on which it feeds, grows throughout
the whole of the country, and forms a common fence
round gardens in many parts of the island. So precious
an insect, and requiring no labour in the preservation
of it, must be a valuable acquisition to
those who would devote their time in looking after
it; but the attention which it absolutely requires
causes the Haytians to neglect it. It is said to have
been in the time of the Spaniards an indigenous insect,
and that in the districts of St. John’s and
Ocoa they usually collected large quantities for the
European market.</p>

<p>The cultivation of tobacco has declined exceedingly,
although the districts of St. Jago and the
whole of the banks of the Yague, as well as the
plains of La Vega, produced an article very little inferior
in its quality to that of Cuba. The large quantities
of this commodity which found their way to Jamaica
were a source of great wealth to the Spaniards
who cultivated it; but that vent being closed, it has
now become much neglected; and as the Spanish cultivators
of it have mostly left the island, and have
gone to the Spanish Main or to Cuba, a little is
still produced by the Haytian planters; but, as with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
respect to every other article derived from the soil,
they are quite careless about the culture of it, and
often leave it to decay, rather than undergo the toil
of preparing it for market. There are other territorial
productions which formerly were considered
important to raise, and which gave the planter very
handsome returns, such as ginger, pimento, rice,
vanilla, palma christi oil (ricinus Americanus), and
sarsaparilla, as well as many indigenous plants that
contain qualities which might make a valuable addition
to the number of useful drugs now comprised in
the Materia Medica. All these may now be said to
be totally disregarded, with the exception of rice,
which is occasionally grown, for I could never ascertain
that any individual devoted the least of his
time to cultivating them, nor did I ever see any of
them exhibited as articles of commerce in any part
of the country.</p>

<p>Having now adverted to the productions of the
soil in Hayti, and the decline of agriculture through
the country, it may not be improper, by way of a
conclusion to this subject, to offer a few remarks on
what is termed free labour, and the consequences
which have arisen from it in Hayti. It seems to me
quite clear that this subject is by no means well understood
in Europe, and that its advocates are
much too sanguine and enthusiastic when they expect
that it would be found practicable to keep
up the tillage of the colonies if their present sable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
cultivators were to be set free. It is indisputable
that the declaration of freedom to the slave population
in Hayti was the ruin of the country, and
that it has not been attended with those benefits
which the sanguine philanthropists of Europe anticipated.
The inhabitants have neither advanced in
moral improvement, nor are their civil rights more
respected; their condition is not changed for the
better. They are not slaves, it is true, but they are
suffering under greater deprivations than can well
be imagined, whilst slaves have nothing to apprehend,
for they are clothed, fed, and receive every
medical aid in the time of sickness. The free labourer
in Hayti, from innate indolence and from
his state of ignorance, obtains barely enough for
his subsistence. He cares not for clothing, and as to
aid under sickness he cannot obtain it; thus he is left
to pursue a course that sinks him to a level with
the brute creation, and the reasoning faculties of
the one are almost inferior to the instinct of the
other, and will be so until moral instruction effect
a change. Had the Haytians been prepared for freedom
by moral and religious education, emancipation
might have done them some good; but even then,
they would not have made much progress unless
agriculture had been legally imposed as a duty, and
the government enforced all the laws enacted for
punishing negligence and disobedience. I have never
yet been able to discover in Hayti, that the blacks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
since their emancipation have improved in the extraordinary
degree which they are sometimes represented
to have done. It is probable that those blacks who
live in the towns may have improved a little. Their
intercourse with the strangers who visit the country
and their avocations afford them opportunities of
improving, which are denied to their brethren in the
interior parts. But to calculate the increase of improvement
from the progress of those in the towns, is
wrong. The whole mass of the people must be taken,
and then, if the measure of moral improvement be
ascertained, it will not be found to exceed one in fifteen.
The state of ignorance prevailing among the
people in the mountains and the interior parts is
almost inconceivable. It appears as if the work of
civilization had not commenced, and that the people
had not taken one voluntary step towards improving
themselves in any one thing. Neither is
there one step taken by the government to force
some degree of attention to those duties that may
eventually improve them, unless, since the conviction
of their own impolitic system of governing, the Code
Rural should effect that change which ought to
have been accomplished before.</p>

<p>If any one suppose for a moment that the present
race of free labourers in Hayti resemble the free labourers
of any other part of the world, he will be most
egregiously deceived. There cannot be a greater distinction
between two classes of people than there is between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
the free labourers in Hayti and those of Cuba
and the southern states of North America. The first
are in a state of profound ignorance, inheriting all
those vices of idolatry and heathenism so peculiar to
the African race; whilst the second, before they received
the boon of freedom, had been taught how to
value it, had received the blessings of a moral and
religious education, and, although they were not
admitted into the general community of free persons,
but formed a class of their own, yet they were
respected and became valuable as labourers. In
the United States the incitements to labour are great,
the most important being that of want; and until the
Haytians are impelled by a stimulus equally powerful,
they will not work; and that such a stimulus
will be found is not probable, while we know that
the labour of a few days will furnish a negro with
sustenance for a month. Experiments may be tried,
laws may be enacted, and encouragement given, but
nothing short of coercion and want will impel the
Haytian to labour; and I have my doubts as to the
practicability of enforcing labour in Hayti until the
people have been better instructed, and their characters
become changed. As to want, the fertility
of the soil is so great that it offers every security
against its occurrence, by the most simple exertions.
It is evident to me, that unless constant labour be
required for the support of the negro, he never can
become like the free labourers in other countries;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
and to imagine that he will work for hire without
coercion, is absolutely to imagine that to be practicable
which is physically impossible. I am well
aware that it has been often asserted that the Haytians
are always found willing to contract, or engage
to perform any proportion of the work required on
a plantation, on being fairly and equitably remunerated
for their labour; but I am bold to pronounce
such an assertion, come from what quarter it may,
to be unfounded. It was, I aver, out of the power
of a proprietor to obtain labourers, although the
most liberal offers were made to them to undertake
a proportion of such work as he wished to be
performed.</p>

<p>It is perhaps unfortunate that the local authorities
in Hayti are individuals without decision, and
too apt to submit to the will of the people; mere
nonentities, without resolution sufficient to command
obedience in their several districts, although
invested with power to commit, or inflict summary
punishment. Hence there is much reason to presume
that the enactments of the Code Rural will
become inefficacious for a more general and extensive
cultivation of the soil, and that agricultural
pursuits will not be the least encouraged or promoted
by its clauses, because the task of enforcing them
devolves on the very imbecile class of persons who
constitute the executive part of the government.</p>

<p>Before I conclude this part of my observations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
I cannot avoid repeating, that Hayti must not
be held up as an example of what can be accomplished
by free labour; but that it ought rather to
be the beacon to warn the government of England
against an experiment which may prove absolutely
fatal to her colonial system. If it be not wished that
a fate similar to that which has befallen Hayti
should overtake our own colonies, that they should
be rendered totally unproductive to the revenue of
the country, and that the property invested in them
should be preserved from destruction, the advisers
of the crown must pause before they listen to the
ill-judged suggestions of enthusiasts; for they must
banish from their minds the idea that the work of
cultivation can be made productive by means of free
labour. Such a thing appears to me impossible. The
negro, constituted as he is, has such an aversion from
labour, and so great a propensity for indulgence and
vice, that no prospect of advantage can stimulate
him, and as for emulation it has not the slightest
influence over him. Without force he will sink into
lethargy, and revert to his primitive savage character,
and the only feasible and effectual plan to
promote his civilization is to persist in those measures
which compel him to labour, inculcate morality,
and tend to extirpate those vices which are inherent
in the descendants of the African race. This
has been often exemplified in cases of Africans
who have been taken from their native soil and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
educated in England. When they have returned to
the spot of their nativity, and have beheld their
kindred indulging in all the habits of savage life,
they have thrown off all traces of civilization, and
embraced with all their primeval ardour the vices
of their native country. As Africa has presented
various instances of this, so has it occurred also
among the Indian tribes, not only of North but
of South America.</p>

<p>I trust that my readers will not for a moment
consider that I am advocating the cause of slavery;
that I have the most distant wish that freedom
should not be conceded to the slave population of
the world; but that, if it were possible, the whole
of the British colonies should be cultivated by free
labourers. Nothing can be more opposite to my
feelings than such a supposition, for I should be
one of the first to exult were the measure practicable,
and were the condition of the slave to be
changed for the better by it. But I have Hayti
before me as an example, as a forcible illustration
of the evils likely to attend such an experiment;
for I am convinced that to attempt it, would inevitably
ruin all interests, be a signal for general
insurrection, and the colonies would then be lost
for ever as a productive possession of the crown,
without improving the condition of the slave. I
venture to make this declaration from a knowledge
of the character of the slave. From having,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
during an intercourse of twenty-two years with
those countries in which slavery exists, minutely
examined him in all his essential qualities, I have
been only able to arrive at the conclusion, that it
will be found an undertaking of extreme difficulty
to change his nature so as to make freedom a good
to him; and even assuming that such an attempt
should be considered practicable, it is evident that
it must be the work of time, and not the result of
any sudden and precipitate act. But I would, with
great deference, call upon my countrymen to deliberate
before they venture upon further experiments,
unless they wish to subvert their colonial
establishments; and not to be hurried into the adoption
of any measure without the most serious consideration
of the consequences which are likely to
ensue from it. I would call upon them to examine
into the state and condition of the Haytian people,
before they adopt any plan, or devise any means,
for attempting to cultivate their colonies by free
labour. The state of the population of this island
is calculated to excite the most painful sensations,
and their abject sloth, indolence, and ignorance,
would, I should think, induce the warmest philanthropists
of England to form the wish that their
condition were rendered equal to that of the slave
population of the British colonies. Their condition
has not been improved by the change from
slaves to free labourers. In point of fact, the slave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
is infinitely better off than the free labourer of
Hayti; in physical circumstances he is particularly
so; and even as regards morality, the former has
the advantage. I say again that Hayti, instead
of being an example of what may be done by free
labour in the tropics, or a proof that agriculture can
be successfully carried on by it, stands as a beacon
to caution us against the rock on which the prosperity
of the colonies is likely to be wrecked.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<p class="pch">Commerce.&mdash;State of exports and imports.&mdash;Exactions

merchants&mdash;disabilities they labour under.&mdash;Insecurity.&mdash;State
of finances.&mdash;Revenue, etc.</p>

<p class="pn2"><span class="smcap">Commerce</span>, like agriculture, in Hayti is at a very
low ebb, and presents a very discouraging view of the
state of that country. Without agriculture commerce
can receive but little encouragement; and if the cultivation
of the soil decline, commerce must decline
also, the one being unquestionably dependent on the
other. If there be a failure in those territorial productions
which constitute the staple commodities of
Hayti, there will be nothing to excite commercial
enterprise and speculation, and consequently the intercourse
with foreigners will decrease, to the great
injury of the country. Were Hayti in a situation
to become an entrepôt for foreign property, or were
it so circumstanced as to have the means of carrying
on an extensive trade with the South American
states, it might probably relieve her in some measure
from the heavy weight with which she is now
borne down. But she has no such intercourse, nor
are the people in the least conversant with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
nature of it: their knowledge of commerce not extending
much beyond the limits of mere petty bartering,
and all important commercial dealings are centred
in the foreign houses established there. The
British, Americans, and even the French, will not
confide in the integrity of the Haytians; all their engagements
are effected, all their arrangements are
made by the agents from their respective countries,
who have patents to reside in the several parts of the
republic. An attempt was made to induce the legislative
body to enact a law for compelling foreigners to
consign their cargoes or shipments to Haytian citizen
agents; and I believe Boyer was much disposed
to countenance the proposition, but it met with
great disapprobation from those individuals in the
chamber of communes who were on friendly terms
with the foreigners, and who had discretion enough
to foresee that such a law would be destructive of
that commerce which they were so anxious to extend.
This iniquitous law was proposed by M. Elic and
M. Ardouin, the representatives for Port au Prince,
and it was supported by other members of the
chamber, who, as native agents, resided in the
several ports, but decried by those who apprehended
the serious check which foreign intercourse would
receive from so unwise and impolitic a measure.
It was, however, negatived, and the proposers and
supporters of it drew upon themselves much obloquy
and reproach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span></p>

<p>The Haytian government has often promulgated
very glowing abstracts of the flourishing state of
its commerce, and would seem to expect that such
accounts should be received as proofs of the <i>rising</i>
greatness of the country. But the very documents
themselves are prima facie evidence of their being a
fabrication. They are gross impositions to lead strangers
into the belief that the intercourse is of importance,
and that considerable advantages accrue
from it to those nations who engage in it with
spirit, and pursue it without relaxation.</p>

<p>As there is no individual wealth in the country,
the means of the people depend upon their own exertions
in the culture of the soil; and therefore
as cultivation has dwindled from the want of industry,
those means must have become exceedingly circumscribed.
Hence it is not probable that the annual
value of the imports into the country can have
so far exceeded the exports from it, as the following
statements, which have been already before the public,
particularly exhibit.</p>

<p>The return for the year 1821, being the year
after the annexation of Christophe’s dominions to
the republic, gives the following balance of commerce
with foreign nations:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p1">Making an excess of imports into the country over

<p class="p1">I think it must be admitted that documents like
the foregoing carry on the face of them evident
marks of their spurious character. Although it is
a known fact that they were issued from the bureau
of government, it cannot for a moment be believed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
that there could be such an extraordinary
excess of imports over the exports in a country the
credit of which has been so often impeached, and
the integrity of the government and people so much
questioned. It is not probable,&mdash;it is not credible,&mdash;that
the enterprising, yet wary, American should so
implicitly confide in Haytian integrity and honour
as to become a creditor of the latter to the extent of
nearly nine million three hundred thousand dollars;
and that the British trader should be led into a
similar mistaken confidence, whilst France and every
other country appear to have acted with the greatest
possible precaution, and always to have obtained
a quid pro quo&mdash;a consideration in return for an
equal value given.</p>

<p>Nothing can be more discouraging to the commercial
intercourse with Hayti, than the irregular
system under which every operation is conducted,
from the highest to the lowest office of the state.
The delays and procrastinations of the officers of
the customs are exceedingly injurious both to the
consignee and to the vessel: a studied dilatoriness
pervades all their proceedings. This delay is well
known to the government, and repeated representations
and remonstrances have been sent in to the
proper authorities, and some remedy particularly
sought for; but they have all been unsuccessful, and
the foreign merchants were left to pursue the best
course they possibly could, to obtain some little expedition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
in their progress through the customs.
The only successful way to obtain this despatch is
by one that never fails in its aim, <i>that of a douceur</i>,
for the principal officers are open to bribes, and they
seem determined not to do their duty without one,
so long as the government sanctions their conduct.</p>

<p>The inconvenience as well as the impositions
under which commerce labours in respect to the
Haytian tariff furnishes another ground of complaint
among foreigners. This is a matter which ought to
be taken into the most serious consideration of the
respective governments who have representatives in
that country. The delay which ensues between the
landing of the merchant’s property, and the examination
of it by the officers of the customs for the purpose
of ascertaining its qualities, agreeably to the
regulations of the tariff, is not only most injurious,
but in Hayti every thing becomes so exposed that depredations
are not unfrequent, and the injured party
has no remedy. The officers of the customs afford
no redress, nor will the government make any compensation;
and in a country where theft is so prevalent,
and justice so seldom overtakes the perpetrator,
there is but little security for property. I have
seen many instances of goods being most unwarrantably
exposed, and all the remonstrances of the consignee
have been unavailing; there appeared on the
contrary every reason to suspect connivance on the
part of those whose duty it was to protect the property<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
against those persons who are always on the
alert to plunder, for they were negligent, and shewed
no wish to detect offenders, and bring them to
justice.</p>

<p>The way in which goods are valued agreeably to
the tariff is a monstrous imposition on the trader,
and imperatively calls for the most prompt and
efficient remedy. Many of the articles of British
manufacture are actually subjected to a duty equal
to twenty per cent. instead of twelve, from the excess
of valuation, the tariff fixing a value nearly
double the actual sale price of the goods; and although
it may be argued that the consumer pays the
duty, yet it seriously affects the sale of the article,
and in most cases is felt very grievously by the consignor.
In no other country have I ever witnessed
such impositions and such depredations as are committed
in Hayti, where the injured individuals have
not the least possible chance of redress. The British
government has been, however, I have no
doubt, apprised of the impositions practised by the
Haytians on our commerce: hence it has been
found adviseable to obtain some change, and in future
to protect it against similar attacks. The
appointment of a consul-general of talents and decision
will, I am confident, bring the Haytian government
and President Boyer to a proper sense of
justice towards those British subjects who have so
long suffered from these impositions. A trade fettered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
with such heavy duties, and charges of various
description, where payment is extremely uncertain
and insecure, from the character of the people and
the state of the country, can never prosper if these exactions
and depredations be not effectually restrained.
I have heard of the ingenuity and dexterity evinced
by the people of the South American states in abstracting
merchandize that may be exposed; but I
am confident that the Haytian may challenge competition,
and on a trial of their respective merits, I
have no doubt of his being pronounced the victor.
The internal commerce of Hayti also as regards
foreigners is rendered quite unprofitable by the
absurd regulations which fetter it. The foreign
merchant has no latitude given to his operations; he
is not permitted to trade with any but Haytian
citizens, and to them alone can he offer his goods.
Though he might be able to effect a more advantageous
arrangement with other importers or
consignees like himself, he cannot even dispose
of the produce of the country, should he have an
excess beyond the quantity which he may require
for exportation; he must ship it, however disadvantageous
it may be. Neither can the foreign merchant
dispose of his goods upon the coast; he is
forced to place them under the agency of a Haytian
citizen for that purpose, and confide in people possessing
but little integrity.</p>

<p>All the produce which the foreigner purchases for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
exportation must pass through the hands of a broker,
to whom he is obliged to pay a commission. He is
not allowed to make his own purchases; but this
difficulty is obviated by an understanding with the
broker, that he shall be paid the commission on
what the merchant may purchase himself. This
commission is about six pence per one hundred
pounds weight of coffee, and other articles in proportion.
The French, by the arrangements of
1825, enjoy a much more extensive intercourse with
Hayti than they did previously, and from their
paying only half duties both on imports and exports,
they are able to compete with the British and Americans,
who before had decidedly the advantage. I
do not know whether any arrangements are likely to
be effected, by which British commerce will be put on
the same footing as that of France, although I should
hope that such a thing is not improbable, or else the
little intercourse that now exists will decline more,
for the French will be able to undersell us, having
so great an advantage as half duties both ways.</p>

<p>In a commercial point of view Hayti presents but
little encouragement to the speculator or adventurer.
There is no extensive sphere for mercantile
operation: every thing is confined within a narrow
compass. The foreigner, with unlimited pecuniary
means, has no opportunity of employing them to
advantage. The heavy exactions of the government
are too burthensome to admit of any successful application<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
of capital, and to invest it under the impression
of security would be an error that might
bring on very fatal results. No such thing as security
exists in that country; a foreigner cannot hold
property in the soil, and he cannot, without a great
deal of inconvenience and expense, obtain a lien
on the real property of a citizen. To bring it to
sale for the purpose of liquidating a debt, would be
impossible, from the corrupt administration of justice;
for the judicial seat is filled by persons who
have not the least idea of either law or equity.
Under all these circumstances, Hayti cannot advance
much in commerce, for she holds out no inducements,
and until the government remove the restraints
which they have put upon it, and give it
greater latitude and freedom, it will not be worth
the foreigner’s seeking, for he cannot benefit by his
operations, and he is exposed to inconceivable difficulties,
and often to severe losses.</p>

<p>The finances of Hayti are exceedingly low; no
country can labour under greater depression in its
financial state than the republic at this moment, and
there does not appear the least probability of a revival.
Without agriculture and commerce, I cannot
see how they are to be recruited, and as those are
at the lowest ebb, despair seems to me inevitable.
Their application to the French government to extend
the period for the payment of the debt due for
the recognition of independence, is corroborative of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
their impoverished condition. The receipts from
all their sources of income are small, and their expenditure
is large, and the government is often
obliged to borrow money of the merchants in anticipation
of duties they may have to pay, for the
purpose of meeting the exigences of the country;
and this has become so very frequent of late, that
they have met with some refusals, merchants entertaining
much doubt as to the safety of making such
advances.</p>

<p>The public expenditure is estimated at about five
millions of dollars annually, which one would think
cannot be true, when a reference is made to the produce
of the country. It is certain their ways and
means fall considerably short of that amount. The
customs on imports and exports produce about two
million two hundred thousand dollars annually, and
the territorial duties on produce, duty on houses,
patents, tax on markets, and other taxes of minor
consideration, about the same amount; so that the
total revenue of the republic does not exceed four
million four hundred thousand dollars. On this I
can place some reliance; for the best informed persons
in the country, both natives and foreigners,
state that amount to be correct, and that it is impossible
that it can be greater, from the condition into
which both commerce and agriculture have sunk.
The government, these last two years, anticipated a
large revenue from the produce of the mines of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
Cibao, but that scheme turned out to be a fallacious
ground-work of expectation; and a great deal also
was expected to be realized by sales of the government
lands, but this also has failed, from landed
property being considered at the present moment of
very insecure tenure. These two anticipated sources
of revenue display the weakness of the government,
and betray their want of foresight in an amazing
degree, for nothing could be more inconsistent than
to calculate upon repairing the finances of the country
by hidden treasures, or think of obtaining any
thing from mines which, had they been known to
be worth working, would never have been neglected
by the Spaniards or the French. With respect to
government lands, I cannot conceive how any expectation
of deriving benefit from them could have
been entertained, when it is so notorious that the
people have not a shilling to invest in the soil; and
the constitution will not permit Europeans, or white
persons from any country, to hold property in their
own right, were they disposed to do so.</p>

<p>No means therefore present themselves by which
the finances of Hayti can be improved, except the
cultivation of its lands in good earnest, not by partial
labour, but by the most persevering industry,
and by enforcing the law for culture. Nothing
short of the most strenuous exertions in agriculture
can save Hayti from the ruin which threatens
her, or can shelter her against the storm which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
seems to be gathering round her. Setting aside the
produce of the soil, there is no other source from
which any aid to the revenue can be derived; and if
that be not attended to, and an increase immediately
obtained, the little commercial intercourse that remains
will dwindle away, and Hayti will sink into an
irrecoverable state of poverty.</p>

<p>Towards both the military and civil establishments
they are exceedingly illiberal. They do not
adequately requite either for their services, which
causes them all to be open to bribes, by which the
revenue becomes defrauded. The soldiers of the
republic are so irregularly paid&mdash;and at times not
paid at all&mdash;that they make up by plunder wherever
they have an opportunity. This is therefore a
mistaken principle of economy; but it is similar to
every other proceeding of the government, and
carries with it every mark of absurdity. To reason
with them in matters of finance would have no
effect, for the vanity of Boyer and his chief advisers
is such, that they think they have arrived at perfection;
they arrogate to that system of government
which they have established the praise of being the
most efficient, if not the most powerful of all the
modern republics.</p>

<p>The same want of system and method, which is
seen in every other branch of the government, pervades
the financial department. The head of that
department has no power; he is a mere nominal character,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
and is often undeservedly exposed to censure
from the extraordinary conduct of the president. It
is not an uncommon circumstance for the president
to issue an order on the treasurer for payment to some
individual who has had a demand upon government,
and after having issued it, and before an application
can be made for payment, a subsequent order has
been given to suspend the payment of it for a time,
by which injustice the treasurer is subjected to great
obloquy and abuse. This is not an uncommon thing;
many of the British and American merchants will
bear testimony to such facts, for they have often
been placed in this predicament. Many to my knowledge,
who have had occasion to transmit money to
Port au Prince from some of the distant ports, have
paid the amount into the treasury, or some other
government department at his own port, and received
a check on the treasurer-general for the amount,
which, when presented, has often been refused, and
it has been by great difficulty, and after great delay,
that the check has been paid. So little confidence
can be placed in the integrity of the government,
that people are no longer disposed to have faith
in it.</p>

<p>I have, I hope, said enough to deter mercantile
adventurers from falling into the trap laid for their
property, by the high sounding and vaunting reports
published by the eulogists of Hayti for the
purpose of delusion.</p>

<p class="pn2"><span class="smcap">It</span> is necessary that I should make a few remarks
on the subject of Haytian jurisprudence, and endeavour
to shew my readers what description of personages
preside over the civil and criminal departments
of justice, as well as explain what sort of an
individual a Haytian justice of the peace is.</p>

<p>I think that every person who has had an occasion
to visit Hayti, and has been an observer of the
way in which justice is generally dispensed, will accord
with me in the opinion that there may be exhibited
the symbol of justice, but that equity is never
dealt out in spirit and in substance; and that whenever
it becomes unavoidable that recourse should be
had to the courts of law for a decision on a disputed
question, it is ten to one in favour of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
suitor who is the most liberal in his bribes to the
judges. It is a fact which cannot be controverted,
that justice in Hayti may be bought; and those who
are appointed to administer it, cannot escape the
imputation of making the chair of justice the vehicle
of corruption. Justice never flows from a pure and
unvitiated source. The civil and criminal codes of
Hayti do certainly provide for its due administration,
and for the protection of property and individuals
against molestation; but there is a laxity in
the courts which deserves the severest reprobation,
and calls for a prompt remedy. There is so much
procrastination, and such inconceivable dilatoriness
in the officers of the courts, that cases of a civil
nature, although of no importance and capable of
being decided at the first glance, are oftentimes
heard and reheard, considered and reconsidered, before
any judgment is given; and those who may
be committed for trial for an alleged offence, are
alike subjected to the tardy proceedings of the law,
and the innocent often suffers, by an unjust imprisonment
before trial, equal in duration to that which
is awarded to an offender after his conviction. The
supineness and apathy of the judges are the subjects
of general condemnation, and their want of discernment
and discrimination renders it frequently necessary
to reverse or suspend the execution of their
judgments.</p>

<p>The law establishing a trial by jury in criminal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
cases passed the legislative body, I believe, in 1826,
but I have not heard of any instance in which it has
been acted upon, nor do I think, from the general
incapacity of the people, that it will be acted upon.
If it be, I cannot answer for the consequences that
might ensue in all cases of crime, where a long investigation
of the different allegations which constitute
it took place. Amongst the people who would
be thought eligible to be summoned on a jury by the
court, few only, if any, would be found capable of
determining upon the guilt or innocence of the party
accused, and those probably would be led by their
passions to convict or acquit, without the least reference
to the charge or the evidence adduced. The
trial by jury in Hayti may be a great blessing to the
people when they are taught to estimate its importance,
as the means of preserving their rights and
liberties. But as they, at the present moment, know
but little of liberty but the name, and have but a
very superficial knowledge of what constitutes their
rights, they are not fit to be trusted with the performance
of so important a duty as to decide upon
the innocence or guilt of their fellow men. Such
being the state of knowledge, I feel confident that
the trial by jury will not be adopted in practice until
the people become more enlightened, and knowledge
be more generally diffused throughout the country.</p>

<p>The court of cassation, which is the court of appeal
from the courts civil and criminal, exceeds, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
the tardiness of its proceedings, all the other legal
institutions of the country. There is no such thing
as an equitable decision emanating from the judges,
for they are under the surveillance of the president,
and before they give their judgment, have recourse
to him to know whether their opinions meet his approbation.
If he concur, they give judgment accordingly,
but should he differ, and the question be one
in which the state is a party, or any state officer,
then they are obliged to reconsider the case, and to
see <i>if they have not taken a wrong view of the
question at issue</i>. After a short period,&mdash;for it is incumbent
on them to preserve their characters as judges
in equity,&mdash;they pronounce judgment with great solemnity,
and with as much appearance of that conscious
rectitude of proceeding as if their investigation
of the subject had been the most unbiassed, and
their decision founded on the purest principles of
law and justice.</p>

<p>The proceedings in the lower courts are somewhat
extraordinary in civil cases. If a creditor institute
a suit against a debtor in one district, and obtain a
verdict, the defendant is permitted to appeal from
the sentence to the court of the adjoining district,
and so on in succession throughout the whole series
of district courts; and if the last confirm the judgment
of the first, the defendant can then move it
into the court of cassation, and in the event of that
court confirming the judgment of the courts below,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
he may appeal from it to the president, and apply
for a new trial in those courts, so that the contest
proceeds ad infinitum, however clear may be the
proof adduced of the debt being just. These unjust
and inequitable acts of the judges and president are
common; and foreigners who are obliged to resort to
legal means for the recovery of their debts, find it
attended with so much procrastination and expense,
in addition to the uncertainty of the result, that they
mostly wait the effect of time for the recovery of
their debts, rather than have recourse to law.</p>

<p>Another most extraordinary, and I call it a most
unexampled power over the courts, is vested in the
hands of an officer denominated the grand judge.
He can stay execution after the judgment is confirmed
as long as he may deem it adviseable; and
although at the time the party is in possession of
means to liquidate the debt, he frequently gives him
one, two, or three years to pay it. In the mean time,
the debtor may dispose of his property in a clandestine
manner, the creditor being left to lament not
only the loss of his debt, but the heavy charges to
which he had been put through the whole of the
delays and chicanery of the law, and the weakness
and unfairness of the judges.</p>

<p>The British merchants in Hayti have been subjected
to the most intolerable impositions, through
the unjust proceedings of the courts of justice;
but it is probable that some check will now be put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
to these iniquitous and nefarious proceedings. The
consul-general is too wary, and too sensible of the
evil, not to be on the alert; and although he may
not have the power to remedy the past, I am confident
he will prevent a recurrence of it in future.
His known perseverance and determination have
shaken the courts already, and his presence there
will, I think, insure to his countrymen that justice for
which they have so long sought in vain.</p>

<p>The judges form perhaps the most extraordinary
selection of personages that could ever have been
found in any country; and their avocations previously
to their elevation to the judicial seat, have
never been professional. The grand judge, Mons.
Freshnell, is an infirm man of colour, nearly eighty
years of age. Until he arrived at middle age, he
had been actively and successfully employed in
the marauding career of a pirate. His legal knowledge
is just what might have been expected from
his previous avocations. He is a modest old man, it
is true; for when his present appointment was offered
to him he declined it, as he said himself, from his
incompetency to fill it, and to perform the duties
which it required. Boyer however insisted on his
accepting it, and remarked “that it did not require
talent or legal knowledge to execute the duties of it,
that he had only to do as he was directed by such
orders as he might receive from the bureau of government”;
so that, in fact, the first law officer of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
the republic is a mere tool of the government, possessed
neither of capacity nor power. He is a mere
instrument of the president, to move and act as he
may be directed.</p>

<p>The chief judge of the court of cassation is a
black, and, like that race in general, exceedingly vain
both of his talents and high station. He is a small
shopkeeper, but generally called a merchant (negociant),
and in that way he is more respectable than
in his judicial capacity. The other judges of this
court are all engaged in some mercantile or similar
calling, and exhibit neither the dignity of expounders
of the law, nor the grave nor placid exterior demeanour
of men on whom devolves the important
duty of distributing justice with an equal hand.</p>

<p>Monsieur Dieu Donney, chief judge of the lower
courts, is a man of colour, and may be considered as
possessing some little knowledge in the laws of the
republic, and would, in all probability, do justice
were he permitted to do so. He is said to be a great
opponent to the practice of suspending judgments
when ready for execution, and has declared it, in the
presence of the president, to be unjust and unconstitutional,
and that before long it would inevitably
be the means of driving all foreigners from the country,
for it gave countenance to the fraudulent designs
of those who were in the habit of obtaining a large
amount in goods on credit, disposing of them immediately
for less than they actually cost, for the purpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
of realizing the money and investing it in lands,
when they knew that in the first place they could,
by the delays of the court, prevent judgment being
taken for two years, and after judgment, might obtain
three years for its liquidation; and in fact, perhaps
in the end, never pay at all, because in the
interim they might dispose of, or make over their
property to another, in trust, and laugh at their
creditor with impunity.</p>

<p>He is, I think, an upright man, and although his
talents are not of the first order amongst his Haytian
brethren, yet he makes up for this by his integrity,
and gives great satisfaction by the justice
of his decisions; but he is often controlled by the
majority of his brother judges, who are as corrupt
as they are ignorant.</p>

<p>The idea which some of the judges have of conscience
is somewhat singular, and may not be unworthy
of notice. They are all very ill paid it is
true, and consequently they are open to bribery, as
I have before mentioned; and whenever a good
bribe is offered, they never consult their consciences
about the justice of the case, but give a verdict as a
quid pro quo for the douceur.</p>

<p>With regard to that respectable officer, a justice
of the peace in Hayti, he is almost indescribable,
being a compound of bad qualities. Speaking of
them generally, they are what may be not incorrectly
denominated retailers of justice, and dispose of it to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
that person who can give the most. They are persons
certainly not very judiciously selected, and in
the different districts where they reside, they exercise
their power very arbitrarily, unless the parties
who may unfortunately be brought before them, for
offences committed within their jurisdiction, can afford
to pay well for a little lenity. An attempt was
made by the justice of peace at Port au Prince, who
is the uncle of Boyer’s mistress, to impose on a British
sailor, who had been illegally discharged from
an American vessel, in which he had sailed, without
payment of his wages, acting, it was said, under the
influence of the agents of the vessel. But the British
consul-general not only remonstrated strongly with
this personage, but threatened to make it a subject
of representation to the president; the fellow however
having afterwards made some submission, and
apologized for his conduct, the matter was permitted
to drop.</p>

<p>Having touched upon the administration of the
laws of Hayti, I shall now offer a few observations
on the church establishment and the moral and religious
condition of the people.</p>

<p>The established religion of Hayti is the Roman
Catholic, the constitution, however, tolerates other
forms according to the letter of the law; but although
it does tolerate other forms of worship, the municipal
authorities take great care that the Protestant sectarians
shall encounter every possible obstacle when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
they wish to meet for the purpose of divine worship.
They will not permit their meetings to be held in a
public manner, and the inhabitants are cautioned
against receiving them into their houses unless they
desist from preaching. What is therefore called toleration
in Hayti it would be difficult to define. It is
not many years since, that a missionary from one of
the societies of England (I think he was a Wesleyan)
was obliged to leave the country, although that individual
bore a most exemplary character, and had
very studiously avoided exciting the envy of the
Catholic priests, or giving the least umbrage to
any person of that persuasion. He set about the
duties of his mission with all the ardour of his
sect, and gained many followers, but the rancour
of the Catholic clergy was roused by his success,
and their malice soon became conspicuous.
This very worthy man, therefore, was subjected to
great insult. His removal was suggested to the
president, and the anathemas of the church were
threatened unless he complied with their request.
He was represented by them to have aimed at
subverting the doctrines of the church of Rome,
and of introducing heresy among the people, to
have preached disobedience to the established authorities,
and to have ridiculed the supremacy of
the Pope. The weakness and submission of the president
forced him to expel this individual from the
island. It is said, however, that Boyer secretly enabled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
him to do so, by presenting him with a sum
of money, and expressing the regret he felt that any
causes of a religious character should have called
upon him to exercise the power with which the constitution
had armed him, as he individually was
sensible of the unreasonableness of that jealousy
which is too predominant in the followers of the
Church of Rome, and which he could not but silently
deprecate.</p>

<p>The Catholic church in Hayti appears to be
in a very disorganized state. The schism in the
church which happened a few years ago has not been
healed, and Boyer, by expelling the bishop of Port
au Prince and Pere Jérémie, (Jeremiah O’Flinns, an
Irish priest,) has incurred severe papal censures,
which, it is said, he has taken no steps to remove.
Formerly the church establishment in Hayti was
numerous, there being no less than an archbishop,
three bishops, and about sixty priests and monks.
But at this time there remain only about thirty or
forty of the latter class distributed in the different
parts of the country, and it is the determination of
the government not to increase their number; the
others will in future be excluded, as the poverty of
the state requires the revenue of the church in aid
of its exigences.</p>

<p>Some of the priests who officiate, are the most abject
and miserable wretches I think I ever saw. They
are poor, and in some of the interior parts they derive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
their sole support from the voluntary contributions
of the inhabitants, but those in the principal
towns have a tolerable income, and seem to enjoy
the good things of this world in common with their
flock. Those who attend at the shrine of Alta
Gracia at Higuey are said to be rich, but their
emoluments arise principally from the offerings of
the poor deluded bigots who go there on their pilgrimage.</p>

<p>The people in general seem to care but little
about religion, and the conduct of the leading men
of the state sets religion and morality at defiance.
The female Haytians who attend divine worship,
and go regularly to mass, are not actuated by any
religious feeling. Going to church is a mere matter
of parade with them, the sabbath being a day of
festivities, and not set aside for religious devotion.
The female congregations which frequent the
churches in Hayti appear better prepared for an
opera, or some other public amusement, than for
the sacred duties of offering up their prayers in
adoration of the Deity.</p>

<p>The men seldom or never go to mass, except on
the days particularly set apart by the government as
public fêtes. On these occasions the president and all
the officers of Hayti go in procession, but the idea of
devotion, I believe, never enters their contemplation.
Such days are merely set aside for celebrating some
particular event, which it is wished should be handed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
down to posterity. These occasions present only
the external symbol of religion, the whole people
being either ignorant or careless of its real character.
Their manner and appearance during the celebration
of mass shew that they have no inward feelings
of piety or devotion.</p>

<p>The moral state of the people is at the lowest possible
ebb. In the towns there is perhaps the appearance
of morality, and persons are apt to conclude that
they have made some progress in general, from what
they have observed in such places where opportunities
are afforded of seeing those of the inhabitants who
have had the benefits of education; but in the interior
there is an infinite difference, and the people
are in the lowest state of moral degradation&mdash;every
thing shews it, their habits and manner of living.
In secluded places they congregate, and follow
all the propensities of nature, and indulge in all
the vices of lust and sensuality without limits and
without control. It is not possible, I think, for any
one to visit their habitations, without returning from
them with a conviction that their present state is
much below any thing that can be imagined to have
existed in the worst state of society in any part of
the world. In the new republics of South America,
in which society is very backward also, the prevailing
habits present some appearance of improvement;
but in the country districts of Hayti there are no
demonstrations of advancement from that deplorable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
ignorance in which they seem to have existed
from the period of the revolution; no change in
their loose and dissolute manners and customs, but a
fixed and determined perseverance in all the primitive
vices of the African race.</p>

<p>If the interior of the houses of the highest class
of people even in the towns display nothing indicative
of that peculiar regard for propriety and
cleanliness which we have heard of as being so
characteristic of the people of colour, in the tropics,
what will be said of the habitations of the cultivators
in the interior of Hayti, where they resemble
more the huts of the most savage tribes of the eastern
and the western world? The former are far from
being in such a condition as to make them desirable
residences; for in fact they exhibit nothing approaching
to that state which is so common with people
of colour in other colonies, the sluggish occupiers
caring little about cleanliness except in the exterior
ornaments of their persons. The huts of the interior
are merely mud edifices with two rooms for
the accommodation of the whole family, and in
which the slaves of the British colonies, and particularly
in Jamaica, would disdain to reside; nor
would their proprietors offer them such miserable
abodes. In these houses filth and every species of
uncleanliness prevail, for the people give themselves
entirely up to their indolent and lazy habits. It is
common to see the pigs and poultry herding with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
the family, and whilst the latter are at their repast,
the former are in attendance, “picking the crumbs
that fall from their master’s table.” One bed often
suffices for all the inmates. The furniture consists
of a very few articles, a table, a stool, two
chairs, a side board, or rather a tray on four legs,
and some bowls made from the calabash as substitutes
for earthenware, with an iron pot or two for
culinary purposes. Every thing seems useful, there
is nothing ornamental, except now and then a small
pier glass in a gilt frame decorated mostly with the
labours of Arachne, and a wood-cut of the cap of
liberty, considered to be an emblematical representation
of Haytian heroism.</p>

<p>It may not be improper to offer a few remarks on
the subject of education in the republic, and which
seems to me to have been represented in colours far
too glowing. Most people, I apprehend, have
formed an opinion of the progress of education from
what they have perceived in Port au Prince, Cape
Haytien, and one or two others of the principal
places, as though those places contained the largest
proportion of the population. This is an erroneous
impression, as the youth in the country parts,
not having the means of education placed within
their reach, are brought up in the darkest ignorance.
This is immediately seen at any of the
little villages through which the traveller has to
pass, for making an inquiry at many of them if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
there were any schools, the answer was generally
“there were none, except at Port au Prince.” In
the north, the public schools established by Christophe,
who really made efforts to disseminate knowledge
and to improve the morals of the people, have
all been suspended and the houses turned into barracks
for the military, to the utter disgrace of the
government.</p>

<p>In Port au Prince there is one school supported
by the republic upon the Lancasterian principle,
and a military school for young men who are intended
for the scientific departments of the army,
and there is a similar establishment at the cape;
but the few schools which are to be met with in the
large towns are merely private institutions to which
youth are sent whose parents have the means of supporting
them. The ignorant cultivators give themselves
no concern about procuring moral education
for their children; and on the score of religion they
seldom feel the least anxiety, for three-fourths of
them are at this moment as rank idolaters as their
forefathers were in Africa.</p>

<p>In the towns also it should be understood the people
are mostly engaged in some mercantile avocations,
or else they are handicraftsmen, or persons
holding some civil or military appointments. They
therefore have not only an opportunity of educating
their children, being contiguous to the schools, but
they have the pecuniary means for doing so. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
cultivators in the country have neither; money in
particular they never have, except just as much as
the sale of their vegetables on a Sunday brings them,
but which is generally disposed of in payment for
the salt provisions, and the supply of taffia required
for their weekly consumption. They have no reserve
for purposes of improvement, nor are they taught to
improve; but the government seems to consider that
to keep them in ignorance is the most secure way
to insure tranquillity and repose to the country.
That such is the feeling of the government I think
is quite evident from the one hundred and seventy-eighth
article of the Code Rural, which I have
given before, and which orders that children shall
be sent to their fathers “to follow their condition
of life.” As long therefore as their parents continue
in ignorance and immorality, it is clear that the
children have no means of profiting by a good example.
It is the prevailing sentiment of the people of
colour, that the blacks should be kept in their present
state of ignorance, and so long as the government
be composed of people of the former class, the
latter will remain in their present abject condition.
As the negro is now situated, he is in a worse state
of degradation than the slave; for although he is
free, he is almost excluded from the general mass
of the population; he is marked with the name of
freedom, whilst he actually groans under despotism
and oppression. In this state he is likely to remain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
until some general change be effected in Hayti
which shall place him in a state of unresisted intercourse
with the more enlightened portion of the
people, by which he may be taught properly to
estimate the value of liberty, and made to participate
in those blessings which it is wont to diffuse.</p>

<p>I do not know a circumstance that shews more
clearly the backward state of knowledge and education
in Hayti than the little progress made by the
representatives of the people in the senate and in the
chamber of communes, for there are many of them
who can neither read nor write. In the senate, out
of twenty-four members I could mention four or
five who, at the time I left the island, could not
write their names, nay, not even their initials. It
may appear strange that the president, who has the
selection of the members who occupy seats in the
senate, should appoint men thus incapable and uneducated
to become his council and advisers. However
strange this may seem to others, it excites no
surprise in my mind, because I am convinced, and
it is a matter of general notoriety, that Boyer wants
only mere passive instruments to obey, and not
canvass or oppose any measures emanating from the
government. Out of about seventy-two members
composing the chamber of communes, there are
twenty-six equally ignorant, and their only qualification
seems to be a sufficient degree of pliancy to
yield a ready assent to any proposition which has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
been submitted by the government for their consideration.</p>

<p>All that government wants of the members of
either house is to keep up the appearance of legislative
deliberation, to give a colour to their own proceedings,
and form a cloak to cover their plans of
oppression and rapacity. The persons selected
in the different communes as representatives, are
those who have been recommended by the government,
for the people have no voice, or, what is
nearly the same, they dare not raise it against those
whom the president has recommended to their choice.
These abject representatives are mere tools in the
hands of government, and as they are well paid,
they care little or nothing for the duties of the station
to which they are elevated.</p>

<p>The senator with his one thousand two hundred
dollars per annum, and the commune with his eight
hundred dollars received from the treasury, would
not hesitate to accede to any proposition, however
monstrous and unconstitutional, in order to secure
his seat, and preserve the favour of the government.</p>

statement.&mdash;Manner of taking the census.&mdash;Checks to
increase.&mdash;Decrease is evident.&mdash;Nature of those checks.&mdash;Increase

<p class="pn2"><span class="smcap">It</span> is a very difficult task to ascertain the exact
number of the population in Hayti, and I may in
all probability not be correct in the statement which
was given to me, although I am convinced that the
individual from whom I received it would not knowingly
have offered me a document containing an
erroneous calculation. Indeed I place great reliance
on this statement, because the official station of its
author affords him information which is not easily
to be obtained from any other source. It appears
that the census said to have been taken in
the year 1824, and the particulars of which I have
in my possession as presented to me personally
by Boyer, is a fabrication of government, promulgated
intentionally to astonish the nations of Europe
with the rapid increase of the population
since the expulsion of the French in the time of
Dessalines. This census when taken into consideration
will appear almost incredible, and, from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
irregular manner in which, even on the confession of
its advocates, it is acknowledged to have been taken,
it will be found unworthy of being received as an
authentic return. It states the number as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table id="t07" summary="t07">

  <td class="tdrl">61,468</td>

<p class="pn1">The incredibility attached to such a statement as
the preceding will be manifested, when it is remembered
that in 1802, in the time of Toussaint, the
population</p>

<p class="p1">Now it must I think be admitted that such an increase
as appears from a comparison of these two
statements cannot be probable. That the population
of any country should double in twenty-two
years, cannot for a moment be believed. Here it
is represented to have more than doubled, for there
is a decrease in the Spanish part of nearly thirty-four
thousand, and the subsequent war with Le
Clerc and the massacres of Dessalines, as well as
the long internal contests between Christophe and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
Petion, are not taken in the scale of decrease. The
census of 1824, therefore, will, I should think, appear
erroneous. That it is prima facie a fabrication,
cannot be denied; and the advantage expected to
result from this falsification I cannot comprehend.
By the statement to which I have alluded as given
to me, and on which I can rely as containing a
more correct return of the population of 1824,
Hayti appears to contain:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pn1">This account of the population carries on the face
of it much more probability than the statement of
Boyer. Indeed I took no little pains to inquire of
individuals conversant with the subject, and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
spoke decidedly against the census of 1824, giving
it as their opinion that it could not have exceeded
seven hundred thousand, at all events seven hundred
and twenty thousand of all degrees. It was their
further opinion that the population had not lately
increased, but on the contrary, from what they could
observe in the different parts through which they
had occasion to travel on their mercantile concerns,
there appeared a great check, and that there was
unquestionably an annual decrease.</p>

<p>The manner in which the government proceeds
in taking a census must inevitably lead to inaccuracy
and error, even where there is no design to
deceive. A census is taken in each arrondissement
by the general commanding, aided by the justices
of the peace in the several parishes composing it,
and as there are no registers kept in those parishes
of births or deaths, every thing is left to estimation,
occasional visits being made to several parts of them
to ascertain the number of settlers. Now many of
these proprietors have possessions in two or three
parishes within the arrondissement; and the returns
of persons composing their family are made in
each of them, and thereby swell the aggregate of the
population much beyond the actual number. And
further, the census is not taken simultaneously in
the several arrondissements, but at different periods,
and it is said, that the cultivators who move from
one to the other, are returned in two places.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span></p>

<p>If the people were industrious, and relaxed from
those vicious courses in which they now too much
indulge; if marriage were more generally diffused,
and morality inculcated; if some system were
adopted which would tend towards a removal of the
evils which now prevail through the republic, the
population would in all probability increase, but
until these are accomplished, such a result is not to
be expected.</p>

<p>It has often been argued that labour in the colonies
is a check upon increase, and that may be possible
when the labour is excessive. But I think it will
be admitted that a moderate portion of labour has
a contrary effect, and this is exemplified in those
states of America where slavery exists. In those
states the increase is very great, and excites considerable
apprehension lest the slave population
should become too powerful a body to be kept in subjection.
Raymond, an American author, and a political
economist, in his remarks on the population
of the United States, gives the increase of the
slaves at one and a half per cent. annually, which
I think is a refutation of the opinion of labour
being a check of so serious a nature as has been
contemplated. In the British colonies I have
seen instances of large families, though the parents
have undergone the regular labour of the plantation;
but in Hayti, where very little labour is performed,
I was not able to discover a solitary instance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
of a large family in any part through which
I had occasion to travel. In the slave states of the
North American Union, the labour of the slaves is
as severe as in the British colonies, and on travelling
through them I saw as many cases of large
families among the slave population as occur among
the white people, so that even severe labour is not
a check upon increase to such a degree as many are
led to imagine.</p>

<p>It must also be remarked, that among the Haytians
there are but very few instances of longevity,
the males seldom exceeding forty or fifty years of
age, and the women probably a year or two more.
At the age of thirty, both men and women have
the appearance of being prematurely afflicted by the
weight of time; the effects, no doubt, of an unrestricted
sensual intercourse and other vices, and
greatly increased by sloth and indolence. In the
slave colonies, on the contrary, men and women
will be found at the age of fifty possessing all the
health and vigour of their sex, whilst those who
have been emancipated, and have imbibed the indolent
habits, and pursued the licentious indulgences
so characteristic of the negro in a state of
uncontrolled liberty, exhibit the decrepitude of age
even at forty.</p>

<p>I have offered the foregoing remarks on population
with a view to shew that it is impossible that
the census taken in 1824 can be correct; and I think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
it must appear conclusive, under all the circumstances
connected with the state of society, that the
large increase of population said to have taken place
between the time of Dessalines and the present period,
rests upon no authority whatever. The habits
of the people manifestly oppose such a supposition.
That for several years there has been no increase,
I am persuaded; and so long as the people are permitted
to indulge in all those excesses which are so
prevalent in the country, I am convinced that their
number will continue to decrease.</p>

<p>I have but little to advance by way of conclusion
to my labours, further than to observe that I trust it
will be seen that Hayti has been too much extolled;
that the extraordinary and rapid strides said to have
been made by its inhabitants, in wealth, morality, and
knowledge, is a fiction which has not the slightest
foundation; and that, before a change can be effected,
ages must roll away and a new people be created.
The present race are too hardened in vice to be
improved by example, or taught the distinction between
that which may benefit the country and that
which must prove subversive of the public good.
Let loose from restraint, without having been first
taught how to enjoy freedom, they have given way
to ungovernable passions, and plunged into every
species of vice. Feeling only the few wants characteristic
of the savage, and those wants easily supplied,
they are careless of all consequences, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
never bestow a thought on the future welfare either
of their posterity or their country; but go on without
the least constraint, fostering and pursuing
every evil and pernicious habit. But such a state
as this must bring on a crisis of no ordinary danger
and difficulty, and Hayti may yet have to endure a
repetition of those scenes of trouble and desolation
which have marked her career from the revolution;
which may shake or perhaps destroy the little fabric
which she has raised, and finally bring upon her
people all those fatal consequences which spring from
morals and habits universally dissolute and relaxed.</p>

<p>Hayti affords us a strong instance of what may be
expected from the emancipation of slaves before they
have been previously prepared to receive this boon
by moral and religious instruction, and a proof that
agriculture cannot efficiently be carried on in the colonies
if it depend on the labour of the enfranchised
slave. Should it be therefore thought expedient
to declare the slaves in the British colonies free
before they have been prepared for such a measure,
and provision be made against the consequences of
that sudden ebullition which emancipation would excite,
the colonies may be taken leave of for ever as a
productive appendage to the crown. Hayti bears
me out in this opinion; for that country presents
a lasting monument of what may be expected from
injudicious emancipation, or what may be effected
by free labour. With the finest soil in the world for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
all the purposes of tropical agriculture, with seasons
the most congenial, with a climate so varied in its
temperature as to be peculiarly adapted for the production,
of not only tropical plants, but those of
America and of Europe also, with a population of
labourers equal to her wants, were they moral and
industrious,&mdash;with all these important advantages naturally
adapted to raise her into eminence and wealth,
yet has Hayti sunk into the lowest state of poverty
and moral degradation. Without agriculture, for the
country displays nothing but waste; without commerce,
for her harbours are empty, and present no
appearance of a revival of trade; with an exhausted
treasury and a diminished revenue; with a heavy
debt and a debased currency, Hayti must finally
be overwhelmed in irretrievable ruin.</p>

<p>One plan however still remains to be tried, by
which she may in time perhaps recover her shattered
state. Let the people be roused to a sense of their
abject condition, and if laws be enacted for the enforcement
of cultivation, let them not sleep, but be
executed with an unsparing hand, and the penalty
which they impose be rigidly inflicted on the disobedient
and the indolent. Those mistaken views
of philanthropy upon which the government has
hitherto proceeded have proved destructive to the
country, and the effects of ill-judged leniency are
now too heavy to be any longer borne. Coercive
measures are now, it is said, to take the place of mild<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
ones; the people are not to be permitted to pursue
their own uncontrolled courses as heretofore, nor the
indolent to slumber with impunity. All are to spring
forward as with one impulse, to an extended culture
of the soil, for the purpose of restoring the country
to its ancient condition.</p>

<p>I wish the promise thus held out to the world may
be realized, and that the government may still possess
sufficient energy to give effect to its declared
intention; but I have my doubts of both. The president
is incompetent, and the government weak
and imbecile; and whilst the present rulers are permitted
to hold the reins of the state machine, I for
one cannot hope that the country will emerge from
that miserable condition into which an unwise policy,
and an overstrained and mistaken philanthropy, have
unfortunately thrown it. Time, it is said, effects
wonderful changes, but I fear no change can take
place for the better in Hayti until there be a new
race of people, under the dominion of a chief competent
to rule them with efficient energy.</p>
